1
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,617
Excuse me, sorry.

2
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,197
For those of you

3
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:30,097
that don't speak English,

4
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,834
please engage myself
or any of my colleagues

5
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,570
located in the back
so we may inform you

6
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,005
about our language
and orientation programs,

7
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,440
which are held in
this very room,

8
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,143
425 Lafayette.

9
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,712
Remember that address.

10
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,548
Additionally, classes
and daily meetings are held

11
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,717
where many of you
will be sleeping tonight

12
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,586
over at the Hotel Marseilles,

13
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:55,022
located on 103rd and Broadway.

14
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,123
Those of you for whom

15
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,491
none of the aforementioned
details apply

16
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,027
and who will be
immediately departing

17
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,462
for other destinations
in the morning,

18
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,366
please see me about
your $25 travel aid.

19
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,636
These vouchers
are redeemable on trains

20
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,972
and participating bus services.

21
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,710
This is Albert B Chandler.

22
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,579
At this time, I would like
to introduce a boy

23
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,282
who will be under
the leadership of Babe Ruth

24
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:25,086
when Babe takes over his new
job as director of baseball

25
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,954
for the American Legion.

26
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,690
Representing the boys
of the American Legion,

27
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,660
speaking for every American boy,

28
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,629
ladies and gentlemen,
here is Larry...

29
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,126
It has been some time, sorry.

30
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,361
What's wrong?

31
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,696
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

32
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:09,897
I... I do.

33
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:13,367
Which parts of me
do you find most beautiful?

34
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,704
- All parts.
- Stop it.

35
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,073
I don't find all the
parts of you beautiful.

36
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,778
Fuck her.

37
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,445
Can you tell your
friend to be polite?

38
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,287
My legs? Are they too thin?

39
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,456
No.
You are well proportioned.

40
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,329
It is the space above your brow

41
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,631
for me which is the problem.

42
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,933
What did you say?

43
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,768
That is something
I do not like.

44
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,840
Your face is ugly.

45
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,710
I know it is.

46
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,789
We have boys, if you prefer.

47
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,692
No, thank you.

48
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:15,696
Brothers with dark
skin, but handsome.

49
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,867
No, no. Not for me.

50
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,304
- Wait!
- Wait!

51
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:25,373
Wait! Wait!

52
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,640
- Hey!
- Hey!

53
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,010
Hey! Hey! Hey!

54
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,544
- Hey, thank you. Thank you.
- Thanks.

55
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,651
It was great. It was great.

56
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,555
I will see you.

57
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,224
- I will see you.
- I will see you.

58
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,092
- I will see you.
- Great. Wait, wait.

59
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,830
- For the luck. For the luck.
- Thanks.

60
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,899
- Bye, friend.
- Bye, friend.

61
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,967
See you.

62
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,470
Bye.

63
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:07,915
See you.

64
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,812
Perhaps
no state or nation

65
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,515
in all the history of man

66
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:22,983
has been the deciding ground
of so many human issues

67
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,252
as has the state
of Pennsylvania.

68
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,622
Decisions that founded
and assured survival

69
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,658
of a great nation,

70
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:30,824
that brought into being

71
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,227
important colonization
movements,

72
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,896
that established freedom
of worship in America,

73
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,232
that founded great religions,

74
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,368
that gave birth to America's
educational system,

75
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,438
that launched
tremendous industrial empires,

76
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,676
that forged the steel sinews
and powered the driving wheels

77
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,711
of today's great civilization.

78
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,381
Here is where things happen,
where decisions are made,

79
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,884
where industry is making
the greatest strides

80
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,853
of any state or
nation in the world.

81
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,288
Pennsylvania.

82
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:05,426
Land of decision for America,
for American industry,

83
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,161
and for American families.

84
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,873
Attila.

85
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:28,082
Cousin.

86
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,083
Cousin.

87
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,092
Erzsébet is alive.

88
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:42,796
What? What?

89
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,320
Yeah?

90
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,066
Yeah?

91
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,812
Thank you. Thank you.

92
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,327
It's a
combination of things,

93
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,662
but I would say

94
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,131
the most popular
is the cabinetry

95
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,669
which we do ourselves,
custom-to-order.

96
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,337
The lamps, too.

97
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,375
And here it is.

98
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:06,046
Audrey did the
displays.

99
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,285
He's talking like an American
from the television now.

100
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,888
Yes, well,
we don't have a television,

101
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,491
but he's been here
since before I was born,

102
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,960
and still doesn't sound like
any American I've ever met.

103
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,763
Eight years ago,

104
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:24,833
we tried opening something
similar in Manhattan.

105
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,534
We lasted two months.

106
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,003
We couldn't compete
with the name brands.

107
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,640
Newlyweds, they come in with a

108
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,843
an issue of Better
Homes and Gardens

109
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,343
and they say...

110
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,649
"We like... We like that table
next to the perfume ad."

111
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,351
And we say, "Well, we can
make you something like that."

112
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,455
And they say, "No, sir,
we want exactly that."

113
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,760
Yeah. Turns out
we don't like New York at all.

114
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
No charm, right, Audrey?

115
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,764
Every little urchin
you come across,

116
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,533
and seller, buyer, delivery boy,

117
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,134
is running a hustle.

118
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:04,572
I'm from Connecticut myself.
Do you know it?

119
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:08,208
Of course he doesn't know it,
Audrey. He just got here.

120
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,210
Give me that.

121
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,347
So...

122
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,316
Cleared out a space
for you in the back.

123
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,319
Audrey made you a bed.

124
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,064
It's just there.

125
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,334
A cot and a lamp for now, but

126
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:38,172
feel free to take anything
you want from the showroom.

127
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,308
That's all I need.

128
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:46,280
And for the employee restroom,
you go out the front door,

129
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,716
around the back to where
I parked the car,

130
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:49,983
you remember?

131
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,922
There's a stairway there that
takes you up to our apartment.

132
00:15:53,922 --> 00:15:56,524
If you need anything,
you just knock.

133
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,961
You and your wife
have done more than enough.

134
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,441
You know, we know someone

135
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,511
who could take a
look at your nose.

136
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:21,516
I thought maybe no
one would notice.

137
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,185
What happened?

138
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,021
If you don't mind my asking.

139
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:32,760
I jumped from a railcar.

140
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,064
A few moments later, there was
a loud cracking sound and

141
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,567
I thought someone
had shot me in the head,

142
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:43,237
but I'd merely run
into the branch of a tree.

143
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,508
No one was shooting at me.

144
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,444
I take something
for the pain but.

145
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,583
I'd like to have it
looked at. Thank you.

146
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,820
We'll give Kenneth a call.

147
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,824
Come. Take a seat at my desk.

148
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:04,692
I'll fetch some towels.

149
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,280
Is it smaller than you expected?

150
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,750
What?

151
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,586
Oh, the shop.

152
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,821
No.

153
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,691
No, I had no expectation.

154
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,299
Who is Miller?

155
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,670
I'm Miller.

156
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,205
No, you are Molnár.

157
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,976
Not anymore.

158
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:02,517
- No Miller, no sons.
- Yeah.

159
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:05,987
The folks here,
they like a family business.

160
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,433
So what do you think?

161
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,737
Of what? The furniture?

162
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:25,640
No, well, I meant
of everything so far.

163
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,474
Philadelphia.

164
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,844
But, sure, the pieces
on the floor also.

165
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:33,447
They're not very beautiful.

166
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,891
Well, that's what
you are here for.

167
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,427
Maestro.

168
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:53,735
Next month, I can put
you on the payroll.

169
00:18:55,903 --> 00:18:57,872
If you want,

170
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,707
you can eat with us
upstairs on Sundays.

171
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,544
You have done more than enough.

172
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,948
- Don't mention it.
- I do mention it.

173
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,181
I do mention.

174
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,600
She's Catholic.

175
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,739
We are Catholic.

176
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,603
We welcome donations
of food and clothing.

177
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:03,971
Please help the homeless.

178
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,544
Help the homeless.
Please help the homeless.

179
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,415
Your donations help to provide
shelter, food, clothing...

180
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:17,819
Please help the homeless.

181
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,657
Help the homeless.

182
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,962
It's your
turn now, William.

183
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:29,897
Please help the homeless.

184
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,734
I spy with my eye
something blue.

185
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,770
Help the homeless.

186
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,577
Is it this gentleman's coat?

187
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:46,581
He's clever.

188
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:49,517
You're right. There is
a little blue in it.

189
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,318
Listen up!

190
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,188
Kitchen's closed, folks.
Get back early tomorrow.

191
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,022
Oh, oh!

192
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:58,693
Wait! Hold on. I got a kid here.

193
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:02,096
Sorry, we're fresh out.

194
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,164
Come find me in the morning.

195
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:04,364
I'll make sure he gets a plate.

196
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,768
You must have a slice of bread.

197
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:10,104
He's just a little boy.
There are children here.

198
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,339
How many times do you
people want me to say it?

199
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,808
There's nothing left here.

200
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,846
Thank you, sir.

201
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,017
Will he be all right?

202
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,387
There's somewhere else
we can try tonight.

203
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,691
Then let him sleep tomorrow.

204
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,494
I will be here early.

205
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,397
Come to me here. I
will hold a place.

206
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,570
Good night.

207
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:48,743
No one deserves
to be on our streets.

208
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:51,913
I don't deserve
to be on our streets again.

209
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,081
Whatever you can spare
from your hearts.

210
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,784
Thank you for listening.

211
00:21:56,784 --> 00:22:00,353
God bless all of you.
Have a pleasant weekend.

212
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,896
Excuse me.

213
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:18,773
Pardon.

214
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,008
- Rabbi Zunz?
- Yes.

215
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,912
My niece and wife

216
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,648
I have learned the two are stuck

217
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:02,116
at the Austrian boundary.

218
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:08,256
Wait not many minutes for me
and we can speak after.

219
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,691
Mikveh Israel can try and help,

220
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:14,161
but from here, it is very
difficult, as you know.

221
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,065
I will wait for you. Thank you.

222
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,466
- Thank you very much.
- Wait. Wait.

223
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:09,844
I'm not sure
what to do with them, is all.

224
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,516
What do you think I
should pair it with?

225
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,786
Leave it.

226
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,155
How?

227
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,091
Leave it like that.

228
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,096
Looks like a tricycle.

229
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,166
What is that?

230
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,670
It's a bike for kids.

231
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:48,682
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

232
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:54,922
Did Peter Piper pick
a peck of pickled peppers?

233
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:02,797
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

234
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:09,203
where is the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?

235
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:32,193
Hey. Come with me.

236
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,398
We have an important
client inside.

237
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:39,767
I furnished him a two-story
office space downtown

238
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,602
on the cheap last year.

239
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:45,540
He's interested in us doing
some built-in work for him

240
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,041
at a residence.

241
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:53,948
Can you give a little smile
for him? Huh? Sell it?

242
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:57,118
Why are you always
such a businessman?

243
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,690
You are selling, always
selling, selling.

244
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,667
Mr. Van Buren.

245
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:18,405
Let me introduce you
to my cousin László.

246
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,276
Please. That's what people
call my father.

247
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:25,312
Call me Harry.

248
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,249
Well, Harry would like
some shelving units installed

249
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:30,684
over at his family's property
in Doylestown.

250
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,186
Sorry to interrupt.

251
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,090
I hoped that someone
might follow me out there

252
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,092
to take a look at
my father's study.

253
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,895
My sister and I would like
to surprise him, you see,

254
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,730
by turning it into
a proper library.

255
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:45,299
How do you mean?

256
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,068
Well, the place is
in complete disarray.

257
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:51,038
A whole mess of
books and paperwork.

258
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:53,440
So I guess we'd just like
some tall shelves

259
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,808
and cabinetry installed.

260
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:59,146
Maybe make him a ladder
with little wheels on it.

261
00:27:59,146 --> 00:28:01,348
You know? Like you'd see
in a real library.

262
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,553
He's a voracious reader.

263
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,755
Yeah, we can make you
something like that.

264
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:11,025
Let me have Audrey come down
and keep an eye on the place

265
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:13,093
and I'll pull the van around.

266
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,828
- Fantastic.
- I'll be right back.

267
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:34,481
They pay you well?

268
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,184
On the last job

269
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:39,787
they paid okay.

270
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,123
Took on a lot of pieces, though.

271
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:44,491
They kept adding to the order.

272
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,160
Even at a discount, it adds up.

273
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,930
His old man got flush

274
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,900
adapting production techniques

275
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,504
to expedite the manufacturing
of cargo ships during the war.

276
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,742
Christ, is this guy
trying to shake us?

277
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:04,378
Thinks it's a drag race?

278
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,947
Hey, come on, already!

279
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,491
Stay right until
you see the main house.

280
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,126
You can park wherever you like.

281
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:51,660
I do appreciate
you coming out here

282
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,494
on such short notice, gentlemen.

283
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:55,929
Father is away only
until next Friday.

284
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,732
I was anxious to pin this down.

285
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:00,234
Ah, it's no
inconvenience for us, chief.

286
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,970
It's your lucky day, too,

287
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,308
'cause my cousin here
is a licensed architect,

288
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,176
a specialist in renovations.

289
00:30:09,176 --> 00:30:12,813
He even designed a library
back at home before.

290
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,815
Right? A whole city library.

291
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,183
What city is that?

292
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:22,156
- Budapest.
- I see. Never been.

293
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,826
Don't mind the mess.

294
00:30:33,367 --> 00:30:36,203
I know. It's terribly
dated, isn't it?

295
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,744
I'm thinking shelves
up to the ceiling

296
00:30:42,744 --> 00:30:45,346
and some good reading lamps.

297
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:47,348
Perhaps some wall
fixtures that extend.

298
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:52,052
Father always keeps
the curtains drawn.

299
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:54,455
It is to protect the books
from the sunlight.

300
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,957
We are south-facing here.

301
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,326
Sure.

302
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:04,098
- What's your budget?
- What's your estimate?

303
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:06,701
Depends on the materials.

304
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:11,506
Well...
make it of reasonable quality.

305
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:15,409
Perhaps a nice place for him
to sit and read as well?

306
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:18,312
A good chair or a bench
for him against the window.

307
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,289
You want for us to replace that?

308
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:33,293
If there's time, why not?

309
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,631
A branch fell on it during
a nasty storm last summer.

310
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,501
Tropical depression, I
think they called it.

311
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:45,973
Keep it below $1,000, can you?

312
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,308
My sister and I
are splitting it.

313
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:51,613
I don't want any
unexpected add-ons.

314
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:54,582
Don't worry.
We'll come in on budget.

315
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:58,051
You want all this done
by next Friday, right?

316
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,354
Thursday
night, preferably.

317
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:02,055
I can't be here during the week,

318
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,091
but the staff can let you in.

319
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,359
If anything comes up,

320
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,529
have them ring me at the office.

321
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,364
If to be finished on Thursday,
we need extra hands.

322
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:13,500
Including materials, glass

323
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:17,572
it's $2,000.

324
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,582
♪ East is east
And west is west ♪

325
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:30,685
♪ And the wrong

326
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:33,287

00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,534
Ah, okay.

342
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:21,803
You should have
seen him

343
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,103
talking up the prices.

344
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:25,339
I was ready to settle at 450.

345
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,875
- I was not doing that.
- You were.

346
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:29,476
I was not. I was telling him
how much it will cost.

347
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:33,715
No, I... I thought he was
going to blow it for us.

348
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,650
But you held your ground.

349
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,186
And that's what makes
you professional.

350
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,526
I hope it
is not only that.

351
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,127
She's so beautiful.

352
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:50,598
Look at her. She
has that red dress

353
00:33:50,598 --> 00:33:54,134
and it's the same as...
color as her lips.

354
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,506
Dance with her.

355
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,876
Dance with her.

356
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:03,678
- I don't want to dance.
- Go on.

357
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,379
- I don't... I don't...
- Come on.

358
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,214
I don't want to. No, thank you.

359
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:08,516
He doesn't want to.

360
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,919
Don't make her...
Don't make her wait.

361
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,352
Dance with her.

362
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:17,825
It's her favorite song, man.
It's her favorite song.

363
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,628
We'll do it together,
I'll show you the steps.

364
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:21,763
Dance with her.

365
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,298
Dance with her, dance with her.

366
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,633
She wants you to.

367
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,234
- It's her favorite song.
- Attila.

368
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,703
It's her favorite song.

369
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:32,139
Go on. Dance with her.

370
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,240
Don't...

371
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,809
She's waiting for you.

372
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,744
- She's waiting for you.
- Okay, all right.

373
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:41,248
All right, all right.

374
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,985
- Don't.
- Yeah!

375
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,085
- You're an idiot.
- Go on!

376
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,286
Get off.

You see?

387
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,832
Like riding a bicycle.

388
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,302
Tricycle.

389
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:38,806
Family.

390
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:43,077
It is a bike for children.

391
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,313
Children!

392
00:35:58,092 --> 00:35:59,426
You missed the toilet.

393
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:16,577
What?

394
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:19,814
Better than
the carpet, I suppose.

395
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,787
When do you expect your wife
might join you, Mr. Tóth?

396
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:30,825
There's not room for the both
of you in that storage space.

397
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,231
I wish I knew, Audrey.

398
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,242
Thank you for the dinner.

399
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,849
Attila showed me
magazine pictures.

400
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,785
The projects you
did at your firm.

401
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,657
You're not what I expected
from what I read about you.

402
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:08,663
I'm not what I expected either.

403
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,737
You know,
I'm sure you could get a job.

404
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,474
A better job.

405
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,811
At a firm here.

406
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:36,423
I then...

407
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,795
would be working for someone.

408
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:46,768
It's better than sleeping
in a storage closet.

409
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,645
I'll look for
somewhere else to stay.

410
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:08,956
Thank you again...
for the dinner.

411
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,653
Bring the boxes.
Don't drop them.

412
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:39,687
Here, here, here.

413
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:44,225
The guy is rich,
he's gonna buy more books.

414
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,527
You be respectful.

415
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:47,662
The guy likes to read.

416
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:49,997
He can tell us a bedtime story.

417
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,733
Okay.
Slowly, slowly. Slowly.

418
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:56,436
Slowly.

419
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:57,638
Don't scratch the floor.

420
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,392
Yes, the long panels.

421
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:21,062
The shelves can vary in height

422
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:22,964
to accommodate
the larger volumes

423
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:25,099
our client had been
stacking on the floor.

424
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,268
So, 45 degrees.

425
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:29,904
Three, two, one.

426
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:40,480
Perfect. It will be beautiful.

427
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,792
That's it.
That's good, that's good.

428
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:58,099
Left, Gordon, left. And steady.

429
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,401
Careful now, left.

430
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,271
One steady movement.

431
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:05,072
Come on, one steady movement.

432
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,575
Slowly.

433
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,442
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

434
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:11,879
It's too close to the roof!

435
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,114
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

436
00:40:15,149 --> 00:40:16,050
Oh, no!

437
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:23,991
- I told you to pull!
- I did what I could.

438
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,627
We have a piece of guttering
to replace now as well.

439
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:33,134
One, two, three.

440
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,146
Yeah.

441
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,850
Okay.

442
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:54,088
Put it... bring your hand...

443
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:10,705
It's good. It's good, it's good.

444
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:13,140
Dance with me.
Dance with me again.

445
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,120
Attila.

446
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,495
It's
a first edition.

447
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,030
They're all first edition.

448
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,669
You're an idiot.

449
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,104
Stop it. Idiot.

450
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,045
What is this?

451
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,648
What is all this?

452
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,518
Who authorized you to come
into my home

453
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,352
and tear everything apart?

454
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:08,022
- Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
- Who the hell are you?

455
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:12,426
This was all supposed
to be a surprise.

456
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,328
Your son Harry told us
not to expect you...

457
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:15,629
It is a goddamn surprise!

458
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:17,498
My mother, an ailing woman,

459
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:18,866
is sitting outside
on the driveway

460
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:20,835
too frightened to come inside.

461
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:22,369
We're sorry to have
frightened her.

462
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,106
We brought her here
for some peace and respite,

463
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:27,108
only to discover a
strange Negro man

464
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,843
roaming around our property.

465
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:32,813
Your son... asked
us to come here

466
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,783
to redo the study
into a library.

467
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:38,886
A library?

468
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,189
The room

469
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:46,127
it's gutted!

470
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:48,829
Well, we were just putting
everything back in its place.

471
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,532
You've turned it all inside out.

472
00:43:50,532 --> 00:43:52,800
How do you know
its proper place?

473
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,668
We have taken excellent care

474
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:56,804
of your belongings,
Mr. Van Buren.

475
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:58,873
I... I don't know
what to tell you.

476
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,042
Who are you?

477
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,378
László Tóth.

478
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:09,618
Lás... László's a
licensed architect.

479
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:11,785
He supervised the renovation

480
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:14,321
and I've done business
with your son before.

481
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:17,892
I have a furniture shop
down in Kensington.

482
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:19,561
Miller and Sons.

483
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:22,564
Mr. Van Buren, may I show you
around the space?

484
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:25,933
The... The work lamps are not
doing the work any justice.

485
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,902
Your Negro man is waiting
for you outside the gate.

486
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:29,270
I suggest you pack your things
and leave.

487
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,778
Mr. Van Buren

488
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:41,715
we are finished here.

489
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,085
It's quite all right. Come.

490
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:50,691
I will confirm this
with my son in the morning.

491
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:53,794
My mother is sick.

492
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:56,096
She needs to be inside
so she can sleep!

493
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:58,799
It's quite all right?

494
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,069
This is not all right,
this is my home!

495
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,371
Goddamn you!

496
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:43,511
Wake up.

497
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,282
That's a hell of a
way to greet the day.

498
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:00,794
Harry Lee called.

499
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:03,931
He says he won't pay.

500
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:12,773
For... For the materials?

501
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:18,045
He says
we damaged the property

502
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:19,947
and I'm lucky if he doesn't
take me to court.

503
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,356
Got nothing
to say to that?

504
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,961
What are you going
to do about it?

505
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:38,299
László...

506
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:49,910
You run
my clients out the door.

507
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:56,216
You make a pass at my wife.

508
00:46:57,885 --> 00:47:00,854
She told me. Of
course she told me.

509
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,959
Of course she told me.
What do you expect?

510
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:09,196
Well,
what did I expect?

511
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,598
You couldn't keep
your hands to yourself

512
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:11,999
even when we were kids.

513
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:14,569
Listen.

514
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:17,871
I won't tell Erzsi this time.

515
00:47:22,076 --> 00:47:23,477
I know you've been
through a lot.

516
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:28,048
That's what I told...
told Audrey too.

517
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:37,391
I'm not going to hurt you.

518
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:40,928
But I can't help
you anymore either.

519
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:44,465
You got that?

520
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,870
Good morning, Philadelphia.

521
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,706
It is Thursday,
November 7th, 1950.

522
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:27,575
This could be the
first time since 1930

523
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:30,144
that the Republican Party
may seize control...

524
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,345
Gordon.

525
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:33,447
Gordon.

526
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:36,718
US and United Nations forces

527
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,653
have made significant advances

528
00:48:38,653 --> 00:48:39,953
on the Korean peninsula...

529
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:46,661
Wake up. Gordon.

530
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:49,664
Come on.

531
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:51,932
Wake up.

532
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:12,386
We gotta go.

533
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:14,522
I let you sleep
in. Time to get up.

534
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,032
Oh. Gordon.

535
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:28,302
Has Mr. László already gone?
I need to speak with him.

536
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:30,471
Hold on.

537
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:43,350
Hey, there.

538
00:49:56,598 --> 00:49:58,031
László?

539
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:04,572
It is for my injury.

540
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:06,641
Sister Elizabeth
is asking for you.

541
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,080
I will be right there.

542
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,518
Do me a favor and hold off on
that until we punch the clock.

543
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:36,504
What did she want
to talk to you about?

544
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,640
She asked
for my participation.

545
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,975
Like what?
They want you to help out?

546
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:42,810
I already help out.

547
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:48,415
She wants me to attend
the service on Sundays

548
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:51,351
and collect donations.

549
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,353
And what did you say to her?

550
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:58,292
I said I would think about it.

551
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:00,662
That seems fair, no?

552
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:06,734
I go to somewhere else.

553
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:13,273
Why don't you ask
for a place to stay,

554
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:15,275
wherever it is that you do go?

555
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,585
I do not permit my people from
home to see me as a beggar.

556
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,218
Never.

00:52:58,513 --> 00:52:59,514
Huh.

574
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,651
László Tóth, is that you?

575
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,386
I've been looking for you.

576
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,324
No wonder I couldn't find you,
you've grown a beard.

577
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:19,000
What can I do for you, sir?

578
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,069
I would like
to take you to lunch.

579
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:26,641
We do not break for
another two hours.

580
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:29,242
Point out your manager.
Let me educate him.

581
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:31,679
Have you seen that?

582
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,284
I can assure you
everyone else has.

583
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:39,687
Flip to page 66.

584
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:51,298
Where did you study?

585
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,236
Bauhaus in Dessau.

586
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:58,773
Bauhaus? How marvelous.

587
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,877
Uh, read the caption
below the photograph.

588
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,450
So what do you think?

589
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:14,321
Looks good.

590
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:15,388
Damn right it does.

591
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:18,893
Why didn't you defend yourself

592
00:54:18,893 --> 00:54:21,562
when I came after you all
like a bat out of hell?

593
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:25,767
I called that American cousin
of yours, um...

594
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,069
- Attila.
- Yes. Yeah, that's right.

595
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:30,738
First, I apologized,
then I lauded him with praise.

596
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:34,575
However, he, quite honorably,
redirected me to you.

597
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:37,779
And I have since
done my homework.

598
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,985
These are yours, yes?

599
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,667
Yes.

600
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:00,735
All of them?

601
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,944
Yes.

602
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:12,412
I'm sorry.
Have... Have I upset you?

603
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:14,515
No.

604
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,384
Not at all.

605
00:55:21,722 --> 00:55:25,793
I did not realize these images
were still available.

606
00:55:25,793 --> 00:55:27,427
Much less of any consequence.

607
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:31,065
May I keep these?

608
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:33,366
Of course you may.

609
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,937
They're very artistic.

610
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,374
They're
better in real life.

611
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,411
You could've elaborated
a little more

612
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:45,478
on your background.

613
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:46,781
You didn't...

614
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,549
You didn't do yourself
any favors back there.

615
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:53,120
It was difficult to interject
amidst all of the shouting.

616
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,524
Yeah.

617
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:58,491
Yeah, I... I'm ashamed.

618
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:02,830
Really, I am, I

619
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:04,431
I acted a fool.

620
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:06,834
My...

621
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,571
My mother was dying.

622
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,206
It's not an excuse, but she

623
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,942
she died that very
weekend at the house.

624
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:17,745
I'm very sorry
to hear about your mother.

625
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:21,182
Tell me, why is an accomplished

626
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:22,884
foreign architect

627
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:24,919
shoveling coal here
in Philadelphia?

628
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,025
Well, I'm also doing
the construction

629
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:32,026
for a bowling alley.

630
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:36,530
But, um...

631
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:46,607
The Reich rejected myself
and my colleagues

632
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:48,042
for our type of work.

633
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:52,079
For it was deemed
not Germanic in character.

634
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,552
Uh, I don't wish to be rude,

635
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:00,655
but I only have
time for the coffee.

636
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,393
You were not prepared
for what you saw.

637
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:06,961
That is understandable.

638
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:11,999
I'm glad you have
come to appreciate it.

639
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,468
I don't just appreciate
it, Mr. Tóth.

640
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,538
I cherish it.

641
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:21,208
I hate surprises.

642
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:24,845
My fat-headed son
should have known better.

643
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:27,181
But listen, I'm not here
to boast or to grieve.

644
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:30,518
I've come to pay you
the monies you're owed.

645
00:57:33,187 --> 00:57:35,957
For what it's worth,
it was not my suggestion

646
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:37,858
you and your partner
should not be paid.

647
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:40,828
I only found out about
that after the fact.

648
00:57:40,828 --> 00:57:43,965
We damaged some guttering
which we intended to replace,

649
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:45,866
but it was a misunderstanding.

650
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,535
Forget it. Take the money.

651
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:52,506
Thank you.

652
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:58,379
I'd stash that in your
undergarments, if I were you,

653
00:57:58,379 --> 00:57:59,680
or inside of a shoe.

654
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:04,251
I would like you to come
and see it in the daylight.

655
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:07,989
I've already seen it.

656
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,559
I'd like you to come
and enjoy it, rather.

657
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,364
- All right.
- Wonderful.

658
00:58:16,364 --> 00:58:18,498
I can have a car come
and pick you up Sunday morning

659
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,267
if you're... if
you're not too busy.

660
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:22,536
No.

661
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:26,574
Here. Write me
down your address.

662
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:43,290
I've found our
conversation persuasive

663
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,860
and intellectually stimulating.

664
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:48,796
Bye.

665
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,032
It was a pleasure.

666
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:57,865
Hey, hey, don't move too much.

667
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:05,540
Going to be some minutes!

668
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,974
One second. Hold this.

669
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:57,559
Yes, he inside.

670
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,628
Everybody left.
It's time to go. We're closed.

671
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:01,530
Don't push! I know
he is in there.

672
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,730
Ain't nobody in there.

673
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,398
My friend would not
leave me! Please.

674
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:06,167
Ain't nobody in there!
It's time to go.

675
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,668
- No! No.
- We're closed.

676
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:10,171
Now go on home.

677
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:12,773
Listen, my friend
is in there, please!

678
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,610
- Oh! My nose!
- I said go home.

679
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:14,669
Hey, mister,
the picture's over.

680
01:02:14,669 --> 01:02:15,903
You can't sleep here.

681
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,904
Big
demand is for these

682
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,272
derivatives of opium,

683
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,873
the narcotic drugs...

684
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:21,108
useful in medicine

685
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:23,712
to relieve pain and
to induce sleep.

686
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:25,446
Used without supervision,

687
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:29,149
they can become dangerous,
habit-forming drugs.

688
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:31,785
Once the habit is
formed, the addict...

689
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:35,657
must have a continual
supply at all costs.

690
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:36,957
Hmm?

691
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:38,259
Lawfully imported drugs
are not available to him.

692
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:39,960
He must turn to
an illegal source.

693
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,161
Come.

694
01:02:42,363 --> 01:02:43,864
Come with me.

695
01:02:43,864 --> 01:02:46,066
Good kitty. Come with me.

696
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:49,470
- Just come.
- Excuse me, Mr. Tóth.

697
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,440
The Van Buren family
sent me for you.

698
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:07,187
On the seat there beside you,

699
01:03:07,187 --> 01:03:08,856
there's a pressed dinner jacket.

700
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:32,212
Ah. There you are!

701
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,383
Man of the hour.

702
01:03:38,218 --> 01:03:39,554
What have you done to yourself?

703
01:03:40,755 --> 01:03:42,122
Fell off a beam and...

704
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:43,257
Everyone's famished.

705
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:44,526
Harry, you remember each other.

706
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,228
Yes, I do. Afternoon.

707
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:50,331
Daddy, the kitchen's asking

708
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:51,666
if we could please
take our seats.

709
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:54,301
And this is Harry's
twin sister, Maggie.

710
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:57,004
Hello, Mr. Tóth. We
love the library.

711
01:03:57,004 --> 01:03:58,640
Thank you.

712
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,107
All right, let's eat.

713
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:02,910
He won't tout his own
accomplishments, but

714
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,713
Mr. Tóth's work is celebrated

715
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:07,348
throughout much of Western
and Central Europe.

716
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:13,020
There are many features on him
in architectural journals,

717
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,488
if you follow that
sort of thing.

718
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,624
What was your focus?

719
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:27,602
Uh, theaters,
synagogues, restorations.

720
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:32,406
Many projects but
some quite unusual.

721
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,275
Are you married, Mr. Tóth?

722
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:39,079
Yes.

723
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,484
She's still in Europe.

724
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:46,019
Why's that?

725
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:50,592
We were separated.

726
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:53,494
Forcibly.

727
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:00,000
Where is it you come from,
if you don't mind my asking?

728
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,236
I... I can't place the accent.

729
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:03,538
The city of Budapest.

730
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,574
Stop it.

731
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:10,277
Ravaged during the war.
Just terrible.

732
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:12,514
What was it like, the war?

733
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:16,551
We hear some stories here
that make one's toes curl.

734
01:05:20,688 --> 01:05:22,022
I would not know

735
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:23,525
where to begin, Mrs. Hoffman.

736
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,095
Do you plan on
returning to Europe, Mr. Tóth?

737
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:40,274
But my wife, she tries to come
now, here, to join me.

738
01:05:41,843 --> 01:05:44,646
But the situation is difficult.

739
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,413
Well, with
Roosevelt gone now,

740
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:47,582
that should make things easier.

741
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:51,251
He is gone, but

742
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:53,153
everyone is still frightened

743
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:54,589
that people like me

744
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:57,157
are a threat to their
national defense.

745
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,565
When you say "people,"
you mean Jews?

746
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:07,535
We're Jewish.

747
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:11,138
Michelle converted.

748
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,577
Mm.

749
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:19,581
As did my Erzsébet.

750
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:24,686
It required a great
deal of commitment and study,

751
01:06:24,686 --> 01:06:27,254
but

752
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:30,023
few at home
recognized her for it.

753
01:06:30,023 --> 01:06:33,661
A pity the National Socialists
could not see it their way.

754
01:06:35,897 --> 01:06:38,633
But no, not only Jewish.

755
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:40,568
Foreign people.

756
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:46,240
I was fortunate to depart
from Bremerhaven when I did.

757
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:52,446
Truman's order facilitated
the transfer of my group.

758
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,350
Others were not so lucky.

759
01:06:59,052 --> 01:07:01,154
That sounds very
painful, László.

760
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:04,191
We're terribly sorry for you.

761
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,796
Michael is my friend
and my attorney,

762
01:07:08,796 --> 01:07:10,163
in that order.

763
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,366
Michael, is this a process

764
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:14,536
your firm could
help to expedite?

765
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:17,639
It is not so simple, I'm afraid.

766
01:07:20,575 --> 01:07:25,379
My wife cannot leave my niece
behind because she is

767
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:30,484
young, motherless,
and is very sick.

768
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,521
It's just the two of 'em?

769
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,593
I'd be glad to make an enquiry
on your behalf.

770
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,094
You know there's something

771
01:07:41,094 --> 01:07:42,664
called the Displaced Persons Act

772
01:07:42,664 --> 01:07:44,431
that's recently
gone into effect.

773
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:49,202
It will allow some
200,000 European persons

774
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:50,805
admission for
permanent residence.

775
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:54,141
You can read about
it in the paper now.

776
01:07:55,075 --> 01:07:56,310
Michael's firm represents

777
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,411
the office of the
Vice President.

778
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:01,549
The President?

779
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:04,052
Of the United States.

780
01:08:04,052 --> 01:08:06,253
Congratulations.

781
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:10,992
Come see me in our
Philadelphia office on Monday.

782
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:15,362
Telephone this line,
and my assistant can arrange.

783
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:18,365
She'll tell you what we'll
need you both to provide.

784
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,169
Thank you.

785
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:27,207
I think we'll take
coffee in the study, huh?

786
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:33,781
Thank you.

787
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:40,655
I was married once.

788
01:08:42,356 --> 01:08:44,424
She gave me two
beautiful children.

789
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,296
Nevertheless, my mother,
Margaret, and the twins

790
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:50,598
demanded my attention

791
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:52,800
every minute of my
scarce personal time.

792
01:08:53,801 --> 01:08:55,302
Things became awkward

793
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:57,905
between my ex-wife and Margaret.

794
01:08:57,905 --> 01:08:59,807
So we separated.

795
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,743
Amicably.

796
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:03,878
Margaret raised me on her own
in Rochester.

797
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:05,245
It was just the two of us.

798
01:09:06,914 --> 01:09:11,184
Her parents had disowned her
for a child out of wedlock.

799
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:16,356
She was my only real family,

800
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:19,493
other than the twins
later on in life, of course.

801
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:22,730
I'll tell you

802
01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:25,465
shortly before their death,

803
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:28,536
my mother's parents,

804
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:30,838
I hesitate to call
them my grandparents

805
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:33,941
they reached out
to Margaret and me

806
01:09:33,941 --> 01:09:34,942
after reading an article

807
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:37,679
on the reported success
of my first company.

808
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,380
In actual fact

809
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,751
we weren't doing
that well at the time

810
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:45,553
and would soon
shutter our doors,

811
01:09:45,553 --> 01:09:47,588
but this was not yet
public knowledge.

812
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:58,365
I gather you conclude from our
prior interactions I am blunt,

813
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:01,836
not hyperbolic or
particularly sentimental.

814
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:06,239
But my mother

815
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,646
she was defenseless
against their chumminess.

816
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:14,214
She argued that
they could very well

817
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:15,650
be sick or dying and

818
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:19,386
quite likely needed the money.

819
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:25,760
I didn't like seeing Margaret,
an ordinarily pragmatic woman,

820
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,361
reduced to such
bromidic assumptions.

821
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:30,998
Still, I agreed
to meet with them in person,

822
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:32,767
in part to appease her,

823
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:37,270
but also to satisfy
the curiosities of my lineage.

824
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,273
Do you know, it
really is very clever.

825
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:43,010
The way the space surrounds one,

826
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,478
the forced perspective.

827
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:46,147
I think so, yes.

828
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:49,584
It reminds me
of a short story I once read.

829
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,753
It's about a
never-ending library.

830
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:54,421
Are you working on anything
at the moment, Mr. Tóth?

831
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,692
A bowling alley.

832
01:10:57,692 --> 01:10:59,660
Pardon me,
I was just in the middle

833
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,162
of telling our
friend here a story.

834
01:11:01,162 --> 01:11:04,331
I'm so sorry. Not at all.
Please excuse me.

835
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:14,742
You agreed to see them.

836
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:18,646
We
exchanged pleasantries

837
01:11:18,646 --> 01:11:20,681
over the telephone and
I offered to meet with them

838
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:22,282
at their modest
apartment residence

839
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:24,619
in a neighboring
town.

840
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:25,853
I laughed to realize

841
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:27,789
they'd been so nearby
all those years.

842
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,490
On the drive over.

843
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,829
I had time to think.

844
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,697
And I finally
arrived at a figure

845
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:39,667
I felt comfortable
in offering the two of them,

846
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:42,469
seeing that they were,
whether I liked it or not,

847
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:45,273
our only living relatives.

848
01:11:45,273 --> 01:11:47,742
I was received hospitably,

849
01:11:47,742 --> 01:11:51,646
so I swiftly moved to explain
I'd made them out a check

850
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,815
for the amount of $25,000.

851
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:58,586
When I handed it over,
they appeared relieved,

852
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:00,988
but perhaps a little
disappointed at the figure.

853
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:04,025
They were courteous
and thanked me all the same.

854
01:12:05,193 --> 01:12:06,828
I was quite uncomfortable.

855
01:12:09,096 --> 01:12:12,967
But before hurrying off,
I asked them a question.

856
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:16,671
What will you do
with all this money?

857
01:12:19,273 --> 01:12:22,543
They rambled on about miracles
or some such thing.

858
01:12:22,543 --> 01:12:24,812
For a moment, everything
in their immediate

859
01:12:24,812 --> 01:12:28,683
line of view seemed
solvable, achievable.

860
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:30,450
They would finally
be all right and

861
01:12:31,552 --> 01:12:33,988
what a thoughtful
grandson I was.

862
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:36,824
Upon departure

863
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:41,162
before I even reached
the edge of their front lawn,

864
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:43,865
the two of them came running
out after me, shouting.

865
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,768
"You've forgotten
your signature, Harrison."

866
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:52,273
I summoned the
courage to be frank

867
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:54,208
and to speak to them as adults.

868
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,744
I had not forgotten, I said,

869
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:58,813
but was not ultimately
compelled to sign

870
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:00,781
due to the blunder
of their response.

871
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,755
They took it as such a shock.

872
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:09,323
I thought for a moment
it might kill them

873
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:10,825
right there on their front lawn.

874
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,928
But the two of them just wept
and came apart like beggars.

875
01:13:13,928 --> 01:13:17,497
The whole thing
was so much more disturbing

876
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:18,699
than I'd imagined.

877
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:22,770
And so on condition

878
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:26,908
that they let Margaret
alone from then on.

879
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:30,177
I struck them a separate check

880
01:13:30,177 --> 01:13:31,812
for $500 and I signed.

881
01:13:34,682 --> 01:13:37,885
That is how much
I loved my mother, Mr. Tóth.

882
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:40,922
We did things for each other.

883
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:43,624
What could they expect

884
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,760
after the way they
had treated you both?

885
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,396
Yes, yes,
that's exactly how I see it.

886
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:50,097
Answer me something.

887
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:53,500
Why architecture?

888
01:13:57,071 --> 01:13:58,172
Is it a test?

889
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:01,509
No, it is not.

890
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:14,789
Nothing is of its
own explanation.

891
01:14:21,195 --> 01:14:24,265
Is there a better
description of a cube

892
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:26,499
than that of its construction?

893
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,839
There was a war on.

894
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:32,907
And yet

895
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:35,810
it is my understanding that

896
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:41,649
many of the sites
of my projects have survived.

897
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:46,187
They remain there
still in the city.

898
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:52,760
When the terrible recollections

899
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,763
of what happened in Europe
cease to humiliate us.

900
01:14:57,531 --> 01:14:59,800
I expect for them to serve

901
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,738
instead as a political stimulus,

902
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:07,008
sparking the upheavals
that so frequently occur

903
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:10,077
in the cycles of people hood.

904
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:21,589
I already anticipate

905
01:15:21,589 --> 01:15:25,760
a communal rhetoric
of anger and fear.

906
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:34,101
A whole river of such
frivolities may flow undammed.

907
01:15:39,473 --> 01:15:44,578
But my buildings were devised
to endure such erosion

908
01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:46,247
of the Danube's shoreline.

909
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:53,988
What a poetic reply.

910
01:15:57,024 --> 01:15:59,093
You must have been
a beloved professor.

911
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,798
I've said it before,

912
01:16:03,798 --> 01:16:05,766
but I find our conversations

913
01:16:07,501 --> 01:16:09,470
intellectually stimulating.

914
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:13,074
I agree with you.

915
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:19,947
Everyone, please.

916
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:23,984
Take your brandy
and join me outside.

917
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:26,854
I have a terrific surprise.

918
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:35,229
Where the hell
are you taking us, Harrison?

919
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:36,430
It's freezing out here.

920
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,365
Just try doing
this in heels, Michael.

921
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:51,879
Only
a little further. Come on.

922
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,885
Bear with us, everyone.

923
01:17:00,254 --> 01:17:02,256
Hold your horses,
we're almost there.

924
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:28,215
All right.

925
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,119
As many of you know,

926
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:35,022
this... this past year
has been somewhat difficult

927
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:37,559
for Harry, Maggie and myself.

928
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:38,959
Daddy, it's very cold out here.

929
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:40,562
Shall we go back inside?

930
01:17:40,562 --> 01:17:42,930
Maggie, please. Quiet.

931
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:48,537
I've brought you all out here
this evening in the cold

932
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:51,640
not to glance over my shoulder
at the past,

933
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:57,512
but to join me in looking
forward toward the future.

934
01:17:57,512 --> 01:18:00,014
As you know,
over this rise is Doylestown.

935
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:03,350
And so on this site,

936
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,820
we plan to build a center
for the community

937
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,323
in the name of
Margaret Lee Van Buren.

938
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:13,127
Harrison, that's lovely.

939
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,963
This shall be a
sacred enough space

940
01:18:15,963 --> 01:18:19,033
that perhaps her soul
might inhabit it.

941
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:23,804
A place for gathering,
reflecting, learning.

942
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:26,307
And, Mr. Tóth

943
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:29,210
I would like you to
build this for her.

944
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,812
Something boundless,
something new.

945
01:18:33,147 --> 01:18:35,482
This has shocked you, I see.
I'm delighted.

946
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:36,884
I thought perhaps
you might see it coming.

947
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:40,321
No. No.

948
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:42,657
Listen.

949
01:18:42,657 --> 01:18:47,127
It is no coincidence
that fate brought us together

950
01:18:47,127 --> 01:18:48,896
on the eve of my mother's death.

951
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:52,833
I'm good at reading the signs.

952
01:18:54,603 --> 01:18:57,805
Sir, I do not know
what the commission entails.

953
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:59,139
We'll talk about
the details at home,

954
01:18:59,139 --> 01:19:00,508
but you'll be well compensated.

955
01:19:00,508 --> 01:19:02,109
And also

956
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:04,646
you'll be given a place
here on the property

957
01:19:04,646 --> 01:19:05,813
to live and work.

958
01:19:05,813 --> 01:19:09,149
I think that residing here

959
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:11,018
will allow you the
time and the space

960
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:13,722
to conceive of it properly.

961
01:19:13,722 --> 01:19:15,856
And your family,
should they arrive,

962
01:19:17,024 --> 01:19:18,292
they're welcome here too.

963
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:21,061
What do you say?

964
01:19:23,097 --> 01:19:28,135
Well, I... I... uh

965
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:31,272
I would like to draw something
and then present it to you.

966
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:35,242
You'd like to win
the commission.

967
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,112
All right, you can do that.

968
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,482
It's cold, let's return inside.

969
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:43,585
Come on.

970
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:02,503
Excuse me.

971
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:05,306
I am sorry, I am sorry.

972
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:08,942
A driver brought me here,
I don't recall his name.

973
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:12,781
- Sorry.
- No, I need to get back. I...

974
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:14,915
Could someone possibly
contact the man

975
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:16,785
who dropped me here
this afternoon?

976
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,185
One minute, please.

977
01:20:32,232 --> 01:20:35,436
Mr. Tóth. I'm sorry
to have kept you waiting.

978
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:38,939
Harrison's gone to bed.
He wishes you a good night.

979
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:40,908
Would you help me
to find the driver?

980
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:43,310
Listen

981
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:46,880
I'm terribly sorry
about my father's theatrics.

982
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,349
Must have caught you off guard.

983
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:51,085
It's quite all right.

984
01:20:51,085 --> 01:20:52,520
He often makes these decisions

985
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,355
without consulting
the rest of us.

986
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:57,991
I did not take any
of it to heart.

987
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:59,493
Oh, you should.

988
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:02,062
Oh, you should, you see.

989
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:07,434
My father would
like us to hire you.

990
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:10,237
Oh.

991
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:20,147
Ah.

992
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:26,019
I don't have any
infrastructure here.

993
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:27,454
That's why he's asked me

994
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:29,423
to oversee and assist you
in this endeavor.

995
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:32,727
I have no idea of
the parameters.

996
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:34,361
Once I have distilled

997
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:38,432
the essence of
Father's outburst,

998
01:21:38,432 --> 01:21:40,635
I'll try and make
some economic sense of it.

999
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:43,772
We've quite a full
house this evening,

1000
01:21:43,772 --> 01:21:45,874
so I took the liberty
of making up a place for you

1001
01:21:45,874 --> 01:21:47,174
in the guest house.

1002
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:49,443
We can have your things
sent for in the morning.

1003
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:06,895
Mr. Tóth?

1004
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:10,097
Mr. Tóth?

1005
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,985
One minute.

1006
01:22:34,923 --> 01:22:36,023
Sir?

1007
01:22:39,894 --> 01:22:41,462
You rang for me, sir?

1008
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:44,566
Oh, yes, László, come in.
I've had a vision.

1009
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:51,739
I have some sketches.

1010
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:54,809
I... Also something
I have been working on

1011
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:58,312
which might be applicable
here, if you care to look.

1012
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:01,348
In a moment,
my eyes are bleary. Sit down.

1013
01:23:05,018 --> 01:23:07,120
Pardon my appearance, I have

1014
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,624
I have carpenters
in the forehead

1015
01:23:09,624 --> 01:23:11,325
causing a terrible
ringing in my ears.

1016
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:13,460
You'll have to bear with me.

1017
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,662
I can come back.

1018
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:18,432
Shh! Before I lose
it. Dreams slip away.

1019
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,034
Yes, I know.

1020
01:23:24,438 --> 01:23:26,608
Doylestown,
it's beautiful,

1021
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:29,109
but it's not a cultural
place, you know?

1022
01:23:30,512 --> 01:23:33,347
- Sure.
- But it could be.

1023
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:37,351
If there were an auditorium,

1024
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:40,153
it could host a...
a theater festival.

1025
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:42,524
Sure.

1026
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:44,024
And in the off
season, of course,

1027
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:47,361
the local students
could access it.

1028
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,229
Yes.

1029
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:51,431
And what do you think
about a gymnasium?

1030
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:54,334
I used to practice wrestling
when I was a teenager.

1031
01:23:55,469 --> 01:23:57,672
I have these fond memories
of my mother

1032
01:23:57,672 --> 01:24:00,542
accompanying me to matches
in the neighboring towns.

1033
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:03,377
Perhaps a swimming pool?

1034
01:24:04,278 --> 01:24:05,780
I can't swim.

1035
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:13,420
And perhaps it is too expensive?

1036
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:15,823
Don't talk to me about money.

1037
01:24:15,823 --> 01:24:18,826
Pennsylvania
has more owner-occupied homes

1038
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:20,360
than any other state.

1039
01:24:21,428 --> 01:24:24,566
More small towns
and small cities,

1040
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:27,134
and more people
living in small towns

1041
01:24:27,134 --> 01:24:28,736
than any other state,

1042
01:24:28,736 --> 01:24:30,905
as well as some of
the greatest cities

1043
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:32,272
in the world.

1044
01:24:34,642 --> 01:24:39,246
All this is why Pennsylvania
is truly a land of decision

1045
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:40,882
for families who want
a wonderful place

1046
01:24:40,882 --> 01:24:42,517
to live and work,

1047
01:24:42,517 --> 01:24:45,152
and to enjoy the
richness of leisure

1048
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:47,454
with nearby secure employment.

1049
01:25:07,642 --> 01:25:09,711
Don't talk to him about money.

1050
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:12,312
I've spoken to our friends

1051
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:13,881
at the Bucks County
mayor's office

1052
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:15,550
who are warm to accessing local

1053
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:17,819
and state funding opportunities

1054
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:19,988
on behalf of our project,

1055
01:25:19,988 --> 01:25:24,559
if we are willing to
designate a specific,

1056
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:29,530
and meaningful
component of the center

1057
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:31,766
for Christian congregation.

1058
01:25:33,735 --> 01:25:37,572
But it is a community center
for all people.

1059
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:41,509
What do they want,
a prayer room?

1060
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:44,779
I'm under the impression
they're expecting something

1061
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:50,150
more specific and meaningful
than that for their earmark.

1062
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,886
This, and pending their approval

1063
01:25:51,886 --> 01:25:54,388
of the overall
proposal, of course.

1064
01:25:54,388 --> 01:26:00,061
Excuse me. An auditorium,
a gymnasium, a library.

1065
01:26:00,061 --> 01:26:02,530
Father described it more

1066
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:06,901
more as a reading
room for the public.

1067
01:26:12,073 --> 01:26:15,510
A library and a chapel?

1068
01:26:17,612 --> 01:26:19,747
That is four builds, Harry.

1069
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:22,182
Four, not one.

1070
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:25,520
It's ambitious.

1071
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,624
And I thought you'd like that.

1072
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:36,130
I put in a call to our
frequent contractor,

1073
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:37,565
Leslie Woodrow.

1074
01:26:38,398 --> 01:26:40,935
We first worked with Leslie

1075
01:26:40,935 --> 01:26:43,303
as one of our ship
engineering officers,

1076
01:26:43,303 --> 01:26:45,907
but he's supervised
several important

1077
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:48,976
construction projects
for us since,

1078
01:26:48,976 --> 01:26:50,845
including these offices.

1079
01:26:50,845 --> 01:26:54,849
My father is allocating a sum
of $850,000 to the project,

1080
01:26:54,849 --> 01:26:59,319
which, to me, seems
very reasonable,

1081
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:00,955
if not exorbitant.

1082
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:03,858
If Leslie agrees
to come on board,

1083
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:07,595
then I'll have him start
a budget for us right away.

1084
01:27:07,595 --> 01:27:11,032
Now, this allocation of $850,000

1085
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:16,838
is inclusive of fees
for yourself and Leslie.

1086
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:19,339
Also we've gone ahead
and made arrangements

1087
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:22,176
to start securing you a license

1088
01:27:22,176 --> 01:27:23,544
here in Pennsylvania.

1089
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:27,615
Well, Harry, let's
start digging.

1090
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:34,982
504, 505, 506,

1091
01:28:34,982 --> 01:28:38,619
507, 508.

1092
01:29:07,215 --> 01:29:10,618
...three, four,

1093
01:29:10,618 --> 01:29:15,022
five, six, seven.

1094
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:06,741
Level, level,
level. Higher, higher.

1095
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:09,476
Little higher. Good.
Good, good, good.

1096
01:30:13,547 --> 01:30:18,853
The total area is
2,684 square meters

1097
01:30:18,853 --> 01:30:21,088
including a size able
condensate system

1098
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,991
for harvesting
rainwater, below grade.

1099
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:26,727
Narrow openings you
see here and here,

1100
01:30:26,727 --> 01:30:29,363
they are skylights
that can also be viewed

1101
01:30:29,363 --> 01:30:32,465
as demarcations
of units of space

1102
01:30:32,465 --> 01:30:35,202
on either side of
the entrance hall.

1103
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:38,339
These units are convertible,
multifunctional.

1104
01:30:38,339 --> 01:30:43,611
They offer a total occupancy
of 500 persons on each side.

1105
01:30:43,611 --> 01:30:47,915
Bespoke systems
for seating and storage

1106
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:54,555
allow for a conference,
gymnasium, auditorium.

1107
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:59,160
These rooms of a more standard
size are pre-cast concrete.

1108
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,129
The chapel at the
heart of the building

1109
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,398
contrasted by an
altarpiece of marble

1110
01:31:04,398 --> 01:31:05,833
from the mountains of Carrara.

1111
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,201
I can't see.

1112
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:09,136
Will serve as
the institute's centerpiece.

1113
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,871
Harry, what do you
think about the gymnasium

1114
01:31:10,871 --> 01:31:12,373
being off to the side like that?

1115
01:31:12,373 --> 01:31:13,975
I'm not sure.

1116
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:16,077
I think it looks
like a barracks.

1117
01:31:16,077 --> 01:31:18,679
Well, that's perhaps because
you never enlisted, Harry.

1118
01:31:20,081 --> 01:31:22,783
I think it's all
a great surprise. Keep going.

1119
01:31:22,783 --> 01:31:24,652
Let me demonstrate.

1120
01:31:27,188 --> 01:31:31,993
When the sun travels
from east to west,

1121
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:38,332
wooden beams located
at the base of the towers

1122
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:41,469
will unite to form
the symbol of a cross

1123
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:43,104
upon the altarpiece,

1124
01:31:44,205 --> 01:31:45,940
when they are illuminated.

1125
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:48,542
Extraordinary.

1126
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:49,877
How wonderful.

1127
01:31:49,877 --> 01:31:51,979
Maggie,
will you call for some coffee?

1128
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,383
I think it's
beautiful, Mr. Tóth.

1129
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:57,184
Thank you.

1130
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:59,587
Well, what's the
height of those things?

1131
01:31:59,587 --> 01:32:02,223
Six or seven meters also?

1132
01:32:02,223 --> 01:32:04,759
And did I understand
you correctly,

1133
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:09,797
over 800,000 square feet
of surface area?

1134
01:32:09,797 --> 01:32:12,700
Well, if we can afford
these materials at all,

1135
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,068
Mr. Van Buren.

1136
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:17,238
Sylacauga marble
ships out of Talladega County,

1137
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:19,106
and that might be possible

1138
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:21,375
if I manage to
swing a few favors.

1139
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:24,745
With all due respect,
afford the materials?

1140
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:28,783
Sir, concrete is
sturdy and cheap.

1141
01:32:28,783 --> 01:32:33,354
Concrete? It's not
very attractive.

1142
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:36,090
Perhaps we could split
the difference on materials.

1143
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:42,630
Well, fortunately, the
building's aesthetic

1144
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,865
is not yours to
resolve, Mr. Woodrow.

1145
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:51,705
And Sylacauga marble is white,
like a sheet of paper.

1146
01:32:51,705 --> 01:32:54,675
What I have here
is blue and gray

1147
01:32:54,675 --> 01:32:56,177
with a softer veining.

1148
01:32:56,177 --> 01:32:58,345
I prefer the Italian.
It's more suitable.

1149
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:01,582
Well, I'll have to
do some research but

1150
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:04,118
I know someone talented.

1151
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:07,321
An Italian mason whom I have
commissioned before.

1152
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:09,757
Oh, another detail
before I forget. The name.

1153
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,294
I want to make sure
it's visible, yeah.

1154
01:33:13,294 --> 01:33:17,498
Sir, is this really
what you imagined?

1155
01:33:17,498 --> 01:33:19,433
Am I missing something?

1156
01:33:19,433 --> 01:33:20,734
When Harry called,

1157
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:23,337
he described this to me
as a personal project.

1158
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:25,272
If this is what we
ultimately settle on,

1159
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:26,541
something of this scale,

1160
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:29,210
the timeline will need to be
considerably adjusted.

1161
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:31,112
I'd rather be
alive at 18 percent

1162
01:33:31,112 --> 01:33:33,080
than dead at the
prime rate, Leslie.

1163
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,082
We will not exceed
our allocations.

1164
01:33:35,082 --> 01:33:36,650
Your grandmother
loved marble.

1165
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:37,985
I assure you.

1166
01:33:37,985 --> 01:33:39,687
Harry, where are
we at with our discussions

1167
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:40,888
with the Mayor's office?

1168
01:33:40,888 --> 01:33:42,890
- They're waiting on us.
- Good.

1169
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:45,493
Push them along.

1170
01:33:45,493 --> 01:33:46,694
- It's good.
- Thank you.

1171
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,658
Shit.

1172
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:27,401
M-Morning, Leslie.

1173
01:34:27,401 --> 01:34:29,937
Don't tell me you're
just now getting up.

1174
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:33,207
Two minutes and I'm ready.

1175
01:34:33,207 --> 01:34:36,343
I'll give you three if
you use it to rinse off.

1176
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:38,879
Three.

1177
01:34:39,648 --> 01:34:40,948
I'll wait outside.

1178
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:47,721
Big day.

1179
01:34:48,523 --> 01:34:49,957
Big day. Wake up.

1180
01:34:55,262 --> 01:34:57,431
The Mayor
hasn't got all day, Leslie.

1181
01:34:57,431 --> 01:34:59,400
We're fine, Harry.

1182
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,402
Will your father be
joining us as well?

1183
01:35:01,402 --> 01:35:04,738
No, he's overseas
on business, I'm afraid.

1184
01:35:04,738 --> 01:35:06,173
He sends his regards.

1185
01:35:06,173 --> 01:35:08,543
This is a project
he's very passionate about.

1186
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:10,211
It's a priority for us.

1187
01:35:10,211 --> 01:35:11,879
He asked if he could
telephone you tomorrow

1188
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:13,113
to talk it all through.

1189
01:35:13,113 --> 01:35:14,815
At your convenience, of course.

1190
01:35:14,815 --> 01:35:16,016
Well, sure.

1191
01:35:16,016 --> 01:35:17,384
Sylvia in my office

1192
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:19,987
can set for just about
any time tomorrow afternoon.

1193
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:24,858
Apologies.

1194
01:35:27,795 --> 01:35:30,397
Well, this
is, um... different.

1195
01:35:31,533 --> 01:35:33,434
Very modern.

1196
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:35,069
- Yes.
- All right.

1197
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:37,504
Walk us through what
you have in mind.

1198
01:35:37,504 --> 01:35:39,940
The construction phase alone

1199
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:43,344
will create upwards
of 80 local jobs.

1200
01:35:43,344 --> 01:35:49,116
Carpenters, painters, upwards
of 150 upon completion,

1201
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:51,653
at which point the
facility will need to be

1202
01:35:51,653 --> 01:35:53,555
permanently staffed.

1203
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:55,889
When are you gonna answer
the questions in the box?

1204
01:36:03,364 --> 01:36:04,532
Right.

1205
01:36:06,867 --> 01:36:08,402
Right.

1206
01:36:10,037 --> 01:36:12,873
I would also like to address

1207
01:36:12,873 --> 01:36:17,444
some of the written concerns
and comments

1208
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:22,249
submitted to us anonymously
ahead of tonight's discussion.

1209
01:36:23,518 --> 01:36:28,055
Questions probing
my personal background,

1210
01:36:28,055 --> 01:36:33,260
heritage and ideological
persuasion, if you will.

1211
01:36:35,764 --> 01:36:38,198
As
a foreign person

1212
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:43,203
and a newcomer to Doylestown,

1213
01:36:43,203 --> 01:36:45,906
I see a community in need.

1214
01:36:47,441 --> 01:36:52,846
And this is my only persuasion
of relevance.

1215
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:56,417
Mr. Van Buren,

1216
01:36:56,417 --> 01:37:00,588
a generous patron
and practicing Protestant,

1217
01:37:00,588 --> 01:37:03,257
and I will build a place

1218
01:37:03,257 --> 01:37:05,627
you will be drawn to congregate

1219
01:37:05,627 --> 01:37:08,062
and inspired to worship.

1220
01:37:09,764 --> 01:37:11,065
You may rest assured

1221
01:37:11,065 --> 01:37:15,336
that we will honor
the traditions of Doylestown.

1222
01:37:15,336 --> 01:37:18,472
The Margaret Lee
Van Buren Center

1223
01:37:18,472 --> 01:37:24,244
for Creation and Activity
will be its manifestation.

1224
01:37:24,244 --> 01:37:29,316
A landmark which proclaims
not only "I am new,"

1225
01:37:29,316 --> 01:37:33,087
but "I am part of
the new whole."

1226
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:36,056
Please to pass the, um...
How do you call it?

1227
01:37:36,056 --> 01:37:37,925
No, the torch.

1228
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,961
Right.

1229
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:56,043
Here we have the
chapel interior.

1230
01:37:57,211 --> 01:38:00,481
It is suitable for 119 persons.

1231
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,519
At dawn.

1232
01:38:06,086 --> 01:38:07,589
At sunset.

1233
01:38:12,259 --> 01:38:14,361
- At noon.
- Oh, that's clever.

1234
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:36,818
One of the most
basic commodities

1235
01:38:36,818 --> 01:38:38,185
of the world today,

1236
01:38:38,185 --> 01:38:41,021
and it had its humble
beginnings in a little town

1237
01:38:41,021 --> 01:38:42,757
nestled between the green hills

1238
01:38:42,757 --> 01:38:44,759
of Pennsylvania.

1239
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:53,635
Steel.

1240
01:39:01,175 --> 01:39:02,744
Perhaps no one factor

1241
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:05,179
has been of greater importance
in the forward march

1242
01:39:05,179 --> 01:39:08,148
of American progress
than Pennsylvania steel.

1243
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:18,225
Steel.

1244
01:39:23,631 --> 01:39:26,133
Steel for
great buildings.

1245
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:29,102
Steel for bridges.
Steel for motor cars.

1246
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:38,378
Steel for trains
and for rails.

1247
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:42,216
Steel for planes.

1248
01:39:50,224 --> 01:39:52,159
Steel
for the guns of war

1249
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,661
and the machinery of peace.

1250
01:39:57,765 --> 01:39:59,399
Steel.

1251
01:41:36,263 --> 01:41:38,298
- Right or left?
- On the left.

1252
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:02,422
Could they have walked past us?

1253
01:42:02,422 --> 01:42:05,325
My associate in New York
confirmed they made it on.

1254
01:42:11,065 --> 01:42:12,600
Is that them over there?

1255
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:16,604
No, that is not them.

1256
01:42:18,706 --> 01:42:19,741
Zsófia?

1257
01:42:21,441 --> 01:42:23,845
Zsófia. That is... that is her.

1258
01:42:23,845 --> 01:42:25,178
Zsófia!

1259
01:42:27,582 --> 01:42:28,783
Zsófia!

1260
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:17,431
I did not want
him to be disappointed

1261
01:43:17,431 --> 01:43:20,500
if you were delayed
for any reason.

1262
01:43:28,576 --> 01:43:29,744
Zsófia.

1263
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:36,651
Welcome to America.

1264
01:43:42,056 --> 01:43:43,290
How wonderful

1265
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:45,059
to finally make
your acquaintance.

1266
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:46,694
There was a period of time there

1267
01:43:46,694 --> 01:43:49,030
where we thought
he had made you up.

1268
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:52,166
Isn't it fascinating,
meeting the significant others

1269
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:54,702
of great artists and thinkers?

1270
01:43:54,702 --> 01:43:56,971
Thank you for taking
care of my László.

1271
01:43:56,971 --> 01:43:58,973
As persons
of unique privilege,

1272
01:43:58,973 --> 01:44:00,641
I've always thought
it's our duty

1273
01:44:00,641 --> 01:44:04,545
to nurture the defining
talents of our epoch.

1274
01:44:04,545 --> 01:44:08,448
I, of course,
am devoid of any such talent.

1275
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,884
Truth be told, I.

1276
01:44:11,886 --> 01:44:15,022
I am incredibly emulous
of individuals like him.

1277
01:44:15,022 --> 01:44:17,058
That mustn't
be true, Mr. Van Buren.

1278
01:44:17,058 --> 01:44:18,726
Seems you have done very well
for yourself.

1279
01:44:18,726 --> 01:44:21,062
Father's digging
for compliments.

1280
01:44:21,062 --> 01:44:22,830
Don't indulge him.

1281
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:25,432
- The property is beautiful.
- Isn't it?

1282
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:27,602
Ezsrébet...

1283
01:44:27,602 --> 01:44:30,437
Pardon me, am I pronouncing
that correctly?

1284
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:33,641
That's fine, just fine.

1285
01:44:33,641 --> 01:44:37,444
Feel free to call me Elizabeth
if you prefer it.

1286
01:44:37,444 --> 01:44:39,147
And your English
is impressive.

1287
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:43,050
Thank you. I attended
university in England.

1288
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:45,019
Oh. Where?

1289
01:44:45,019 --> 01:44:48,388
Oxford. To study English.

1290
01:44:48,388 --> 01:44:51,559
And I returned home
for communications.

1291
01:44:51,559 --> 01:44:53,194
And did you do
anything with that?

1292
01:44:53,194 --> 01:44:56,363
Yes. I wrote for
a popular national paper

1293
01:44:56,363 --> 01:44:58,566
at home, Magyar Nemzet.

1294
01:44:58,566 --> 01:45:01,068
Huh. A
journalist. Hmm!

1295
01:45:01,068 --> 01:45:03,671
- Cultural?
- Foreign affairs.

1296
01:45:03,671 --> 01:45:05,807
Well, perhaps
you can help your husband

1297
01:45:05,807 --> 01:45:08,643
sound less like
he shines shoes for a wage.

1298
01:45:08,643 --> 01:45:10,343
Haven't you told them anything
about me?

1299
01:45:10,343 --> 01:45:13,548
László, how long have you been
here now? Four, five years?

1300
01:45:13,548 --> 01:45:15,817
You have no excuse anymore.

1301
01:45:18,686 --> 01:45:20,353
I'm sorry. I got a little
carried away there.

1302
01:45:20,353 --> 01:45:22,322
Will you please pass that back?

1303
01:45:37,337 --> 01:45:38,873
A penny saved.

1304
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:45,345
Sofia, is that right?

1305
01:45:46,214 --> 01:45:47,380
Zsófia.

1306
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:49,851
Zsófia.

1307
01:45:49,851 --> 01:45:51,085
Zsófia.

1308
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,156
Does she understand English?

1309
01:45:55,156 --> 01:45:56,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

1310
01:45:58,491 --> 01:46:01,596
Yes. She understands very well.

1311
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:06,801
The woman
behind the man.

1312
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:16,409
László? May I have a word?

1313
01:46:20,514 --> 01:46:21,883
Yes, sir?

1314
01:46:21,883 --> 01:46:23,251
On Leslie's recommendation,

1315
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:25,152
we've shown your plans
to another architect.

1316
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:27,688
What? Who?

1317
01:46:27,688 --> 01:46:28,823
Just somebody we worked with

1318
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:30,558
on a department store downtown.

1319
01:46:30,558 --> 01:46:32,526
These are minor changes.

1320
01:46:32,526 --> 01:46:34,095
Places they thought
we might save a penny.

1321
01:46:35,096 --> 01:46:36,496
László?

1322
01:46:36,496 --> 01:46:38,866
- Leslie is a bastard.
- Yes, he is.

1323
01:46:38,866 --> 01:46:40,701
That's what we pay him for.

1324
01:46:42,136 --> 01:46:44,939
Ladies, delighted
to have you with us.

1325
01:47:19,674 --> 01:47:22,243
Even
when she was ill,

1326
01:47:22,243 --> 01:47:24,078
she was so beautiful.

1327
01:48:01,115 --> 01:48:03,651
If you want
to start a row with me,

1328
01:48:03,651 --> 01:48:05,920
I might as well
work out my English.

1329
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,922
Stop it. Your English
is perfectly all right.

1330
01:48:07,922 --> 01:48:09,957
It was an unimaginative joke

1331
01:48:09,957 --> 01:48:12,526
he told about you shining shoes.

1332
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:22,570
Tomorrow, I will take you
to see someone.

1333
01:48:23,437 --> 01:48:24,905
A specialist.

1334
01:48:26,807 --> 01:48:29,010
Don't be angry with me.

1335
01:48:35,249 --> 01:48:36,951
Do you not want to
be with me anymore?

1336
01:48:36,951 --> 01:48:38,919
Stop this nonsense.

1337
01:48:40,554 --> 01:48:42,223
Do you think I look older?

1338
01:48:46,227 --> 01:48:48,162
Weareolder.

1339
01:48:48,162 --> 01:48:51,165
Can't you say
anything kind to me?

1340
01:48:51,165 --> 01:48:53,200
I love you, you cow.

1341
01:49:08,517 --> 01:49:11,652
I don't want to

1342
01:49:11,652 --> 01:49:14,321
I don't want to hurt
you, physically.

1343
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:18,793
You won't.

1344
01:49:22,096 --> 01:49:23,964
I had dreams.

1345
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:29,637
Every night, I dreamt
I was with you.

1346
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:34,341
I know what you've done, László.

1347
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:37,745
And it's all right.

1348
01:49:38,679 --> 01:49:40,347
What are you talking about?

1349
01:49:44,218 --> 01:49:46,555
I know.

1350
01:49:46,555 --> 01:49:48,823
I know.

1351
01:49:48,823 --> 01:49:51,959
- I can't do it.
- I know everything.

1352
01:49:51,959 --> 01:49:54,261
I don't want to do it right now.

1353
01:49:54,261 --> 01:49:55,763
You see.

1354
01:49:57,798 --> 01:49:59,733
I became sick.

1355
01:50:00,734 --> 01:50:02,837
Very sick.

1356
01:50:03,704 --> 01:50:05,739
I could hardly breathe.

1357
01:50:07,108 --> 01:50:11,745
I yearned to be with you
and it made me sick.

1358
01:50:13,681 --> 01:50:15,382
I nearly died.

1359
01:50:16,917 --> 01:50:20,855
Between life and death,

1360
01:50:22,022 --> 01:50:25,292
I began having
fantasies about you.

1361
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:29,396
But I realized

1362
01:50:29,396 --> 01:50:35,736
they were not fantasies
at all, but visions.

1363
01:50:39,306 --> 01:50:41,142
I was with you.

1364
01:50:46,046 --> 01:50:50,084
All the time...
...I was with you.

1365
01:50:52,052 --> 01:50:56,824
My László, I know
what you've done.

1366
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:59,293
I'm not jealous

1367
01:51:00,427 --> 01:51:04,298
because I was with
you all the time.

1368
01:51:08,502 --> 01:51:12,973
I know everything
that has happened to you.

1369
01:51:14,775 --> 01:51:17,044
And I am here now,

1370
01:51:17,945 --> 01:51:22,016
and I will never leave you.

1371
01:51:28,989 --> 01:51:31,258
My love...

1372
01:51:31,258 --> 01:51:34,762
My love, I cannot
bear it anymore!

1373
01:51:34,762 --> 01:51:38,065
- I cannot bear it.
- You can.

1374
01:51:39,233 --> 01:51:41,502
You can.

1375
01:51:44,738 --> 01:51:46,874
We have a new life.

1376
01:51:47,642 --> 01:51:49,843
A new language.

1377
01:51:53,948 --> 01:51:56,217
We can start again.

1378
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,610
Houp-la!

1379
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,345
Pardon. Pardon.

1380
01:52:24,345 --> 01:52:27,381
Maggie Lee
lent me some hair color.

1381
01:52:27,381 --> 01:52:29,383
That is wonderful, dear.

1382
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:33,754
László,
are you there?

1383
01:52:33,754 --> 01:52:35,624
Yes, my love.

1384
01:52:35,624 --> 01:52:37,925
The model is beautiful, darling.

1385
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,462
So beautiful.

1386
01:52:43,364 --> 01:52:44,465
Thank you.

1387
01:52:44,465 --> 01:52:45,833
We're going
into town this afternoon

1388
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:47,401
to see Attila.

1389
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:48,969
Would you like to come?

1390
01:52:51,038 --> 01:52:53,374
I have something
this afternoon.

1391
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:56,043
I cannot.

1392
01:53:00,582 --> 01:53:02,116
I've missed him.

1393
01:53:08,022 --> 01:53:12,293
Just hearing him mill about
in the other room...

1394
01:53:15,697 --> 01:53:17,766
It's fantastic.

1395
01:53:33,615 --> 01:53:34,882
Perhaps we should see

1396
01:53:34,882 --> 01:53:37,918
about some language classes
this afternoon.

1397
01:53:37,918 --> 01:53:40,921
You could take the
bus in on your own.

1398
01:53:40,921 --> 01:53:44,091
I'm positive it is the last
place you would like to be,

1399
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:46,927
but it will be good for you,

1400
01:53:46,927 --> 01:53:49,930
and I can brief the instructor
or whomever

1401
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:52,399
about your situation.

1402
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:55,570
Listening to me babble on
will only get you so far.

1403
01:54:02,042 --> 01:54:04,078
Where are you ladies off to?

1404
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:05,979
We're going into town.

1405
01:54:05,979 --> 01:54:08,115
Which town? We have
several nearby.

1406
01:54:08,115 --> 01:54:10,819
Philadelphia. To visit family.

1407
01:54:10,819 --> 01:54:12,520
Ah, the American
cousin, of course.

1408
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,389
- So the city, then?
- Yes, yes, the city.

1409
01:54:15,389 --> 01:54:19,493
Ah. Us as well.
Well, don't just stand there.

1410
01:54:19,493 --> 01:54:21,261
Let us give you and
your auntie a lift.

1411
01:54:22,196 --> 01:54:23,430
Thank you.

1412
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,936
I have a friend
in New York, a newspaper man.

1413
01:54:28,936 --> 01:54:30,839
He's always on the lookout
for new talent.

1414
01:54:30,839 --> 01:54:32,574
Should I mention you to him?

1415
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:34,341
It's very kind
of you, Mr. Van Buren.

1416
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:38,979
Would that mean I would
have to work out of New York?

1417
01:54:38,979 --> 01:54:40,881
Well, perhaps,
in the beginning.

1418
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:42,182
But you don't have the job yet,

1419
01:54:42,182 --> 01:54:43,917
so let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

1420
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:45,386
Of course not.

1421
01:54:45,386 --> 01:54:46,954
I did not mean it
to be presumptuous.

1422
01:54:46,954 --> 01:54:48,322
No, no.

1423
01:54:50,157 --> 01:54:51,492
In any event,

1424
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:53,628
you could always commute there
with me at the start.

1425
01:54:53,628 --> 01:54:55,429
I'm there Monday to Friday.

1426
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:59,366
Yes, that could be fine.

1427
01:54:59,366 --> 01:55:01,301
I would have to speak
with László, though.

1428
01:55:01,301 --> 01:55:02,903
I can assure you,
when ground breaks,

1429
01:55:02,903 --> 01:55:04,806
he will have his hands full.

1430
01:55:04,806 --> 01:55:06,974
And besides, I

1431
01:55:06,974 --> 01:55:09,711
I enjoy showing friends
around Manhattan.

1432
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:11,613
You can't have seen much of it
on your way here.

1433
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:14,148
Penn Station Terminal
was very nice.

1434
01:55:14,148 --> 01:55:16,116
Itisvery nice.

1435
01:55:16,116 --> 01:55:18,018
It's a pity it's so full
of tramps these days

1436
01:55:18,018 --> 01:55:20,487
hassling women and children
with their arms outstretched.

1437
01:55:20,487 --> 01:55:22,423
They line up and
extend from the walls

1438
01:55:22,423 --> 01:55:24,291
as if integral to
its very foundation

1439
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:26,093
like some haunted wall mural.

1440
01:55:26,093 --> 01:55:28,730
Perhaps that is why
I felt so at home.

1441
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:31,498
I'm a former bag lady myself,

1442
01:55:31,498 --> 01:55:35,369
who does also enjoy the work
of the Dutch masters.

1443
01:55:36,671 --> 01:55:38,338
Earthly Delights.

1444
01:55:38,338 --> 01:55:40,675
You heard it just as I intended.

1445
01:55:40,675 --> 01:55:42,443
Very clever.

1446
01:55:42,443 --> 01:55:45,078
But "integral
to its foundation..."

1447
01:55:46,146 --> 01:55:47,381
A mural is decorative.

1448
01:55:47,381 --> 01:55:49,316
It has nothing to do
with the foundation.

1449
01:55:50,317 --> 01:55:52,654
Touché.

1450
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:55,155
Where did you get your passion
for architecture?

1451
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:57,057
Oh,
we've done buildings before,

1452
01:55:57,057 --> 01:55:59,059
but I'd hardly
call them artistic.

1453
01:55:59,059 --> 01:56:02,463
I don't know. Perhaps it was
because my cellar was full.

1454
01:56:03,464 --> 01:56:05,165
Pardon?

1455
01:56:05,165 --> 01:56:07,468
I collect books,
butterflies and such,

1456
01:56:07,468 --> 01:56:10,971
but above all else,
Portuguese Madeira.

1457
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:13,407
I take it every
evening after supper.

1458
01:56:13,407 --> 01:56:15,610
I've done the math, and if
I were to uncork a bottle

1459
01:56:15,610 --> 01:56:17,612
seven days a week for
the next 30 years,

1460
01:56:17,612 --> 01:56:20,247
the maximum of my
life's expectancy,

1461
01:56:20,247 --> 01:56:23,050
I would need no more
than 10,000 bottles, all told.

1462
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:24,619
So once the cellar was full,

1463
01:56:24,619 --> 01:56:27,555
it was time to set about
in a new direction.

1464
01:56:27,555 --> 01:56:30,457
Out of the cellar
and into the sky.

1465
01:56:30,457 --> 01:56:33,327
If you were to drink a bottle
of Madeira every day,

1466
01:56:33,327 --> 01:56:35,162
I shouldn't think
you'd last 30 years.

1467
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:38,600
I always keep good company.

1468
01:56:39,801 --> 01:56:41,134
That helps.

1469
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,042
I wanna be honest and
I want you to be honest too,

1470
01:56:49,042 --> 01:56:50,545
then when we get married...

1471
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:52,814
Whatever you need.
I'm very grateful.

1472
01:56:52,814 --> 01:56:54,147
Yep, thank you. Yep.

1473
01:56:55,048 --> 01:56:56,651
I'm gonna have to call you back.

1474
01:56:57,819 --> 01:56:59,253
How dare you?

1475
01:56:59,253 --> 01:57:00,788
How dare I what?

1476
01:57:00,788 --> 01:57:03,658
You go behind the back!

1477
01:57:03,658 --> 01:57:07,327
You have the meeting
with another goddamn designer!

1478
01:57:07,327 --> 01:57:10,397
Who in the hell is James
T. Simpson? Who is he?

1479
01:57:10,397 --> 01:57:12,466
You want to try
to get me sacked!

1480
01:57:12,466 --> 01:57:15,302
I didn't tell him to meet with
anyone. Of course I didn't.

1481
01:57:15,302 --> 01:57:18,006
You think I feel like working
with you hating my guts

1482
01:57:18,006 --> 01:57:20,775
for the next two
godforsaken years?

1483
01:57:22,175 --> 01:57:25,513
Look, Jim Simpson
is a smart guy.

1484
01:57:25,513 --> 01:57:27,214
He doesn't want to
interfere at all.

1485
01:57:27,214 --> 01:57:29,617
I am not approving
these changes.

1486
01:57:29,617 --> 01:57:31,218
Well, I'm afraid
it's not up to you.

1487
01:57:31,218 --> 01:57:32,820
The casts are already finished.

1488
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,154
We put in that order
over a month ago.

1489
01:57:34,154 --> 01:57:35,389
What?

1490
01:57:35,389 --> 01:57:36,758
This is the first time
you're hearing about it?

1491
01:57:38,325 --> 01:57:40,394
No one tells me
a goddamn thing here!

1492
01:57:40,394 --> 01:57:42,864
Harrison said he would
talk it over with you.

1493
01:57:42,864 --> 01:57:45,700
I'm sorry you found out
this way, I really am.

1494
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:52,105
There. It is mine again.

1495
01:57:52,105 --> 01:57:54,374
He cuts three
meters from the top,

1496
01:57:54,374 --> 01:57:56,310
I add it to the bottom.

1497
01:57:57,011 --> 01:57:58,278
There you go.

1498
01:57:59,179 --> 01:58:00,615
We can't afford all this.

1499
01:58:00,615 --> 01:58:02,684
I'm already over
budget this quarter.

1500
01:58:02,684 --> 01:58:05,085
You take what you need
from my fee, Leslie.

1501
01:58:05,085 --> 01:58:06,453
Come on, what's the difference

1502
01:58:06,453 --> 01:58:08,288
between 40 and 50 feet, anyway?

1503
01:58:08,288 --> 01:58:10,157
The ceilings are
still plenty high.

1504
01:58:10,858 --> 01:58:12,627
Get it approved!

1505
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:14,896
Well, we have a
walk-through next week

1506
01:58:14,896 --> 01:58:17,065
and Jim is supposed to be there.

1507
01:58:17,065 --> 01:58:19,000
Just hear him out!

1508
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,302
You can state your case
to Harrison and Harry Lee.

1509
01:58:22,302 --> 01:58:24,137
I won't open my
mouth, I swear it.

1510
01:58:24,137 --> 01:58:26,473
Stop talking
and get it approved, Leslie!

1511
01:58:26,473 --> 01:58:28,308
For the cantilevered floors,

1512
01:58:28,308 --> 01:58:30,745
we plan to use upside-down
T-shaped beams

1513
01:58:30,745 --> 01:58:34,147
integrated into concrete
slabs down here.

1514
01:58:34,147 --> 01:58:37,919
This will serve both as the
ceiling for the space above

1515
01:58:37,919 --> 01:58:40,622
and provide resistance
against compression.

1516
01:58:40,622 --> 01:58:43,223
Well, which corridor
are we in now?

1517
01:58:43,223 --> 01:58:45,526
Uh, we're below ground here.

1518
01:58:45,526 --> 01:58:48,529
It's a sort of passageway
between the main unit

1519
01:58:48,529 --> 01:58:50,632
and the three
mid-sized modular units

1520
01:58:50,632 --> 01:58:52,432
to the south and southeast.

1521
01:58:52,432 --> 01:58:55,135
I'm sorry, but I don't see how
any of this acknowledges

1522
01:58:55,135 --> 01:58:56,671
my proposed cuts.

1523
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:58,673
I took ten feet off the height
of these damn things

1524
01:58:58,673 --> 01:59:00,541
and now we are 30
feet underground.

1525
01:59:00,541 --> 01:59:02,744
You have added a quarter-mile
or so of tunnel!

1526
01:59:02,744 --> 01:59:06,547
We excavate the entire
diameter of the tunnel system

1527
01:59:06,547 --> 01:59:08,281
- using a full-face method.
- A what?

1528
01:59:08,281 --> 01:59:11,653
So that there is
something inside

1529
01:59:11,653 --> 01:59:15,023
for the people to discover.

1530
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:18,425
And so that it is one
building, not four!

1531
01:59:20,061 --> 01:59:21,596
For its harmony.

1532
01:59:23,397 --> 01:59:25,667
You said it yourself,
Mr. Van Buren,

1533
01:59:25,667 --> 01:59:27,935
you expected it to
be one building.

1534
01:59:27,935 --> 01:59:29,737
Well, now it is.

1535
01:59:29,737 --> 01:59:31,505
I'm sorry, but we are not
going back inside

1536
01:59:31,505 --> 01:59:33,508
until you look us all
straight in the eye

1537
01:59:33,508 --> 01:59:35,943
and you tell us where
you are willing to compromise.

1538
01:59:35,943 --> 01:59:38,445
Jim, please, tell us again

1539
01:59:38,445 --> 01:59:40,548
what it is that you have built.

1540
01:59:41,749 --> 01:59:42,717
Tell us.

1541
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:44,552
I'll tell you what I've built.

1542
01:59:44,552 --> 01:59:47,522
I've built a shopping
center in New Hope,

1543
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:49,157
a hotel in Stamford,
Connecticut...

1544
01:59:49,157 --> 01:59:51,959
Now, Jim, let me remind everyone

1545
01:59:51,959 --> 01:59:55,096
that László has offered to
personally offset these costs.

1546
01:59:55,096 --> 01:59:56,898
No, I'm sorry, but you have
asked me to come here

1547
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:58,800
to tell you what it is
that we do not need.

1548
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,834
Plain and simple,

1549
01:59:59,834 --> 02:00:01,803
the one thing we do
not need is this guy.

1550
02:00:01,803 --> 02:00:03,104
Jim.

1551
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:05,106
I'm sorry, but this
whole thing is just bizarre.

1552
02:00:05,106 --> 02:00:07,008
- You must all see...
- Now, look.

1553
02:00:07,008 --> 02:00:09,677
I really think you two
might see eye to eye

1554
02:00:09,677 --> 02:00:11,112
if you just spent
a little more time

1555
02:00:11,112 --> 02:00:12,279
getting to know each other.

1556
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:15,550
Jim! Listen to me.

1557
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:18,285
Come. Listen to me.

1558
02:00:21,989 --> 02:00:24,158
Come. Come here.

1559
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:25,425
I'm listening.

1560
02:00:29,396 --> 02:00:32,432
Everything that is

1561
02:00:33,167 --> 02:00:34,602
ugly

1562
02:00:36,671 --> 02:00:37,839
cruel

1563
02:00:38,906 --> 02:00:40,474
stupid,

1564
02:00:41,475 --> 02:00:44,344
but most importantly, ugly.

1565
02:00:45,412 --> 02:00:49,617
Everything... is your fault.

1566
02:00:57,592 --> 02:01:00,628
- Jim! That's enough!
- You want to push me?

1567
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:02,997
I think it's time you went home.

1568
02:01:02,997 --> 02:01:04,732
Thank you for your insight.

1569
02:01:07,267 --> 02:01:08,536
I'm sorry.

1570
02:01:10,403 --> 02:01:11,773
He hit me.

1571
02:01:14,876 --> 02:01:16,276
I trust you.

1572
02:01:17,444 --> 02:01:19,981
I trust you, all right?

1573
02:01:25,452 --> 02:01:28,189
Ah...

1574
02:01:29,524 --> 02:01:31,391
It went well, other
than that, I think.

1575
02:01:31,391 --> 02:01:32,660
- Very well.
- Sorry.

1576
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:34,361
- Very well indeed.
- Sorry, I...

1577
02:01:34,361 --> 02:01:36,396
- He's an idiot, though.
- Come on.

1578
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:58,451
- I go home.
- Yeah.

1579
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:03,558
Harrison, you sure
about this guy?

1580
02:02:03,558 --> 02:02:05,927
Look, I know Jim
lost his temper,

1581
02:02:05,927 --> 02:02:08,830
but he had a few points
back there, didn't he?

1582
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:11,666
Look, my office is
fielding complaints

1583
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:13,267
about plans for this place
on a daily basis,

1584
02:02:13,267 --> 02:02:15,203
more or less.

1585
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:19,674
Jim's a Protestant.
Gives folks peace of mind.

1586
02:02:19,674 --> 02:02:21,976
People are worried
it's gonna ruin the hillside.

1587
02:02:21,976 --> 02:02:24,377
We'll do something. A little
event for the community.

1588
02:02:24,377 --> 02:02:25,546
Get them on side.

1589
02:02:25,546 --> 02:02:27,248
And don't worry,
Jim will stay on.

1590
02:02:27,248 --> 02:02:30,318
Yeah, does Jim know that?
I think he thinks he's fired.

1591
02:02:30,318 --> 02:02:32,653
I'll have Leslie
telephone him tomorrow.

1592
02:02:32,653 --> 02:02:35,488
And he can advise from afar.

1593
02:02:35,488 --> 02:02:37,725
Better for morale that way.

1594
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,795
Mayor Kinney!

1595
02:02:43,831 --> 02:02:45,900
Thank you, everyone,
for being here today.

1596
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:55,877
Girls, come in for
this picture. Here.

1597
02:03:09,489 --> 02:03:10,591
All right.

1598
02:03:10,591 --> 02:03:11,959
Right. Everybody ready?

1599
02:03:13,426 --> 02:03:16,797
Yes. Feeling lucky.

1600
02:03:16,797 --> 02:03:19,867
On the count of three.

1601
02:03:19,867 --> 02:03:22,502
Three, two, one!

1602
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:33,147
That's a motor grader.
We used to do it with horses.

1603
02:03:33,147 --> 02:03:35,383
Makes a flat surface to pour on.

1604
02:03:35,383 --> 02:03:36,984
Take a lot of horses

1605
02:03:36,984 --> 02:03:39,186
to do what that thing
can do, William.

1606
02:03:41,155 --> 02:03:43,691
If you want, in the morning,

1607
02:03:43,691 --> 02:03:45,927
we can take you down there
if you're curious.

1608
02:03:47,295 --> 02:03:50,197
What do you say we get you
in one of them machines?

1609
02:03:50,197 --> 02:03:51,832
Sure.

1610
02:03:51,832 --> 02:03:53,601
Big day, Mr. Tóth.

1611
02:03:56,070 --> 02:03:58,773
Yes. Yes, it is.

1612
02:04:00,841 --> 02:04:02,543
Excuse us, gentlemen.

1613
02:04:06,814 --> 02:04:09,617
Leslie mentioned during
our meeting with Jim last week

1614
02:04:09,617 --> 02:04:11,218
that you're planning
on putting your fee

1615
02:04:11,218 --> 02:04:12,720
back into the project.

1616
02:04:13,921 --> 02:04:16,390
Seems a bit
irresponsible, doesn't it,

1617
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:19,260
given your situation?

1618
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:21,829
Will it even last you
to the end of your commitment?

1619
02:04:26,901 --> 02:04:28,970
I will figure something out.

1620
02:04:31,038 --> 02:04:32,940
Have you discussed
it with your wife?

1621
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:37,912
She will be supportive.

1622
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:43,217
Suit yourself. I wouldn't do it.

1623
02:04:44,452 --> 02:04:47,254
I know Leslie certainly
wouldn't do it.

1624
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:49,957
I didn't want you to think

1625
02:04:49,957 --> 02:04:52,059
you'd be setting any
sort of precedent.

1626
02:04:53,427 --> 02:04:56,831
I expect nothing
from either of you.

1627
02:05:04,705 --> 02:05:06,173
How does that work?

1628
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:13,881
The company paying themselves
a fee to finance?

1629
02:05:16,117 --> 02:05:17,885
Do you not think I
deserve to be paid

1630
02:05:17,885 --> 02:05:20,921
for the time and energy
I devote to the project?

1631
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:28,195
Might I make a suggestion?

1632
02:05:30,564 --> 02:05:31,899
You might.

1633
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:36,904
Your niece has made
several of our guests

1634
02:05:36,904 --> 02:05:39,907
very uncomfortable.

1635
02:05:39,907 --> 02:05:41,909
Perhaps you should
have a talk with her.

1636
02:05:44,011 --> 02:05:45,713
About what?

1637
02:05:47,415 --> 02:05:50,151
Don't get me wrong, she's

1638
02:05:50,151 --> 02:05:53,721
she's very lovely
to look at, I know.

1639
02:05:53,721 --> 02:05:56,290
As much as we all dream
of having a little birdy

1640
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:58,959
that keeps her trap shut,

1641
02:05:58,959 --> 02:06:01,662
comes off like a
rude affectation.

1642
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:06,767
And I've tried to connect,
make conversation.

1643
02:06:07,334 --> 02:06:08,836
It goes nowhere.

1644
02:06:13,174 --> 02:06:16,077
Oh, it runs in the family.

1645
02:06:19,914 --> 02:06:22,049
I would like us to be friends.

1646
02:06:23,217 --> 02:06:24,118
Huh!

1647
02:06:28,222 --> 02:06:29,223
Great.

1648
02:06:31,425 --> 02:06:34,161
This is not friendly, Harry.

1649
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:38,632
I didn't say I'd like
to slip my prick into her.

1650
02:06:47,208 --> 02:06:48,242
Forget it.

1651
02:06:50,778 --> 02:06:52,713
I had too much to drink.

1652
02:06:53,681 --> 02:06:54,915
I need a nap.

1653
02:06:59,286 --> 02:07:00,855
László?

1654
02:07:04,526 --> 02:07:05,993
We tolerate you.

1655
02:07:20,274 --> 02:07:24,579
Rub-a-dub-dub, three
maids in a tub.

1656
02:07:24,579 --> 02:07:27,114
Who do you think were there?

1657
02:07:27,114 --> 02:07:30,251
Butcher, the baker,
the candlestick maker.

1658
02:07:44,533 --> 02:07:47,868
It's invigorating, isn't it?

1659
02:07:55,276 --> 02:07:57,244
No, no.

1660
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:00,748
Do you fancy a stroll?

1661
02:08:00,748 --> 02:08:02,049
I swear it.

1662
02:08:02,049 --> 02:08:04,351
They looked exactly
like that popular painting.

1663
02:08:04,351 --> 02:08:05,686
You know the one. Ooh!

1664
02:08:05,686 --> 02:08:08,055
Oh, stop it!

1665
02:08:08,055 --> 02:08:10,424
Daddy kept apologizing
to our hostess.

1666
02:08:10,424 --> 02:08:12,960
For context... For
context, her husband

1667
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,461
was one of Van
Buren Manufacturer's

1668
02:08:14,461 --> 02:08:16,363
most important private clients.

1669
02:08:16,363 --> 02:08:18,098
Daddy tried
to explain everything

1670
02:08:18,098 --> 02:08:19,601
that had made us
late that evening,

1671
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:21,068
as she prepared

1672
02:08:21,068 --> 02:08:24,171
what appeared to be
a delightful-looking trifle.

1673
02:08:24,171 --> 02:08:26,073
- Was it awful?
- Yes.

1674
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:29,511
I kid you not, cow
tallow and fruit pie.

1675
02:08:29,511 --> 02:08:33,080
No!

1676
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,715
And Daddy has such
a sweet tooth.

1677
02:08:34,715 --> 02:08:37,184
I didn't know how to warn him
in front of everyone.

1678
02:08:37,184 --> 02:08:39,186
- I was starving.
- He took a bite this big.

1679
02:08:39,186 --> 02:08:40,955
I was starving!

1680
02:08:40,955 --> 02:08:44,291
He began gagging
like a house cat.

1681
02:08:47,161 --> 02:08:49,997
And all he could say
to explain was...

1682
02:08:49,997 --> 02:08:53,434
"Dear, I'm allergic."

1683
02:08:53,434 --> 02:08:55,637
"I'm allergic."

1684
02:08:55,637 --> 02:08:58,405
To which our
concerned hostess replied,

1685
02:08:58,405 --> 02:09:01,342
"Oh, goodness,
allergic to what?"

1686
02:09:01,342 --> 02:09:04,311
And he said, "To that."

1687
02:09:04,311 --> 02:09:06,648
"I am allergic to
whatever that is."

1688
02:09:16,558 --> 02:09:17,858
Oh, Daddy.

1689
02:09:24,566 --> 02:09:25,866
Let's go.

1690
02:09:27,801 --> 02:09:29,069
Bring the chair, please.

1691
02:09:37,444 --> 02:09:38,479
Zsófia.

1692
02:09:44,318 --> 02:09:45,352
You all right?

1693
02:09:47,988 --> 02:09:50,491
It has
been a lovely day.

1694
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:51,792
It certainly has been.

1695
02:09:52,893 --> 02:09:54,261
Pity the wind's
picked up a little.

1696
02:09:54,261 --> 02:09:58,065
Erszi. It's time for us to go.

1697
02:09:58,065 --> 02:09:59,833
You won't join us for dinner
at the house?

1698
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:02,737
Uh, we start early tomorrow.

1699
02:10:02,737 --> 02:10:04,773
Thank you for the event.

1700
02:10:04,773 --> 02:10:07,374
- Does he ever take a break?
- Never!

1701
02:10:07,374 --> 02:10:08,976
Goodbye,
Mr. Van Buren.

1702
02:10:08,976 --> 02:10:10,512
All right, stay warm.

1703
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:13,847
What's the rush?

1704
02:10:13,847 --> 02:10:15,550
We will talk at the house.

1705
02:10:21,188 --> 02:10:22,923
László, can you slow down?

1706
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,227
Can you slow down?

1707
02:10:29,063 --> 02:10:32,099
I am forfeiting the
remainder of my fee

1708
02:10:32,099 --> 02:10:36,170
due to some expenses unforeseen.

1709
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:38,540
Oh, so that's what the son
kept alluding to.

1710
02:10:39,473 --> 02:10:41,375
Yes. He's a snake.

1711
02:10:46,815 --> 02:10:50,785
All right,
so what will that mean for us?

1712
02:10:50,785 --> 02:10:54,054
- I will figure something out.
- We will figure something out.

1713
02:10:55,155 --> 02:10:57,224
I suppose we can
make do on my salary.

1714
02:10:58,626 --> 02:11:00,194
Your salary?

1715
02:11:00,194 --> 02:11:02,429
Mr. Van Buren's helped me
with a job interview

1716
02:11:02,429 --> 02:11:04,198
in New York City.

1717
02:11:04,198 --> 02:11:05,700
I'm sure once they meet me,

1718
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,501
they won't be able to resist me.

1719
02:11:10,137 --> 02:11:12,439
Thank you
for the supper, Mrs. Tóth.

1720
02:11:12,439 --> 02:11:14,441
I thought we might
have our own little party

1721
02:11:14,441 --> 02:11:16,443
to celebrate all
of your hard work.

1722
02:11:16,443 --> 02:11:19,012
You've come so far,
the both of you.

1723
02:11:19,814 --> 02:11:22,116
Oh, it's not mine, really.

1724
02:11:22,116 --> 02:11:24,051
That's not
what László tells me.

1725
02:11:24,051 --> 02:11:26,920
He says he couldn't have
done it without you.

1726
02:11:29,423 --> 02:11:32,192
So do you have a missus
at home, Gordon?

1727
02:11:33,293 --> 02:11:36,531
Augusta
passed away in '43.

1728
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:39,099
She was sick and died
of a damn tooth infection,

1729
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:40,934
of all things.

1730
02:11:40,934 --> 02:11:42,903
Very
sorry to hear that.

1731
02:11:44,104 --> 02:11:46,373
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

1732
02:11:47,441 --> 02:11:49,143
He's all right.

1733
02:11:49,143 --> 02:11:51,979
He was too young then
to remember much.

1734
02:11:51,979 --> 02:11:54,481
And I was gone two
years in Arizona

1735
02:11:54,481 --> 02:11:57,084
before they shipped us all off
to Naples, Italy.

1736
02:11:57,084 --> 02:11:59,821
92nd Infantry Division.

1737
02:11:59,821 --> 02:12:03,490
They wouldn't let me back home
all that time, not once.

1738
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:07,494
Augusta's sister looked
after him until I got back.

1739
02:12:07,494 --> 02:12:10,397
Kept me alive, though,
knowing he was waiting for me.

1740
02:12:11,465 --> 02:12:14,803
Kept me good and
alive, thank goodness.

1741
02:12:14,803 --> 02:12:17,404
Zsófia's mother passed.

1742
02:12:20,474 --> 02:12:24,278
Losing a mother,
it's an unfathomable loss.

1743
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:27,314
To lose one's birth mother

1744
02:12:27,314 --> 02:12:30,417
is to lose the very foundation
on which we stand.

1745
02:12:32,486 --> 02:12:36,990
The mind may not know its loss
but... but the heart does.

1746
02:12:41,161 --> 02:12:43,464
I remember her.

1747
02:12:43,464 --> 02:12:45,867
That's because I've told you
so much about her.

1748
02:12:45,867 --> 02:12:47,602
You were too small.

1749
02:12:47,602 --> 02:12:50,370
No, I remember Augusta.

1750
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:52,740
I just wanted to make
it easier on you.

1751
02:13:16,163 --> 02:13:17,998
What are you doing?

1752
02:13:22,302 --> 02:13:24,304
I'm just looking at you.

1753
02:13:26,774 --> 02:13:28,208
What do you think?

1754
02:13:29,176 --> 02:13:32,780
It's unusual, even for you.

1755
02:13:34,949 --> 02:13:37,417
- Think so?
- Hmm.

1756
02:13:37,417 --> 02:13:40,320
Many of the rooms
are quite small,

1757
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,924
yet the ceilings are high.

1758
02:13:42,924 --> 02:13:44,258
Yes.

1759
02:13:45,259 --> 02:13:48,362
Inside, you must look upwards.

1760
02:13:48,362 --> 02:13:50,698
So which part of it
are we paying for?

1761
02:13:53,433 --> 02:13:55,402
The height of the ceiling.

1762
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:58,138
The glass above.

1763
02:14:03,043 --> 02:14:04,411
I like it.

1764
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:07,247
I'm so happy you approve.

1765
02:14:43,851 --> 02:14:46,153
The service is in here?

1766
02:14:46,153 --> 02:14:47,454
For the overflow.

1767
02:14:47,454 --> 02:14:49,691
Because of the holiday?

1768
02:14:49,691 --> 02:14:51,391
The community's growing.

1769
02:17:05,960 --> 02:17:09,329
What?

1770
02:17:09,329 --> 02:17:12,133
It's okay. It's okay.
What is happening?

1771
02:17:12,133 --> 02:17:14,602
It's too much.

1772
02:17:14,602 --> 02:17:18,271
- What is too much?
- The pain. It's too much.

1773
02:17:18,271 --> 02:17:21,642
I need Zsófia. She
has my medication.

1774
02:17:21,642 --> 02:17:24,478
Zsófia!

1775
02:17:25,479 --> 02:17:27,515
Zsófia!

1776
02:17:35,355 --> 02:17:36,591
Zsófia.

1777
02:17:41,394 --> 02:17:44,932
Get it. Go to her. Go to her.

1778
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:53,741
Give it to her.

1779
02:17:53,741 --> 02:17:55,810
Take it.

1780
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:58,913
I have everyone
here with me now, yes.

1781
02:17:58,913 --> 02:18:01,883
I see. Well, if there's
anything more we can do.

1782
02:18:01,883 --> 02:18:03,751
We're terribly
sorry for the news.

1783
02:18:05,019 --> 02:18:06,554
On tenterhooks at this end,

1784
02:18:06,554 --> 02:18:09,257
so give me a ring here
when you have something.

1785
02:18:10,423 --> 02:18:12,359
A big section came undone.

1786
02:18:12,359 --> 02:18:14,028
He didn't know which
one for certain.

1787
02:18:14,028 --> 02:18:15,997
And it took seven freight cars
along with it.

1788
02:18:15,997 --> 02:18:17,632
Goddamn it, Leslie!

1789
02:18:17,632 --> 02:18:19,200
How the hell do you
find these people?

1790
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,500
Transport company
is our own, Dad.

1791
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,502
What?

1792
02:18:22,502 --> 02:18:24,672
We sent our own
guys to Charleston.

1793
02:18:24,672 --> 02:18:26,439
The rail
cars were ours too.

1794
02:18:26,439 --> 02:18:28,475
It was cheaper,
given all the back and forth.

1795
02:18:28,475 --> 02:18:30,244
It's well over
a hundred shipments, Harrison.

1796
02:18:30,244 --> 02:18:32,312
You don't utter another word
to the rail company

1797
02:18:32,312 --> 02:18:33,748
till Michael can advise.

1798
02:18:33,748 --> 02:18:35,917
I'm hoping to have some
answers for you soon, sir.

1799
02:18:37,585 --> 02:18:41,055
Can we see what can
be salvaged? How far is it?

1800
02:18:41,055 --> 02:18:43,791
The accident put two brakemen
in the hospital.

1801
02:18:43,791 --> 02:18:45,159
It's a real mess out there.

1802
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:46,393
Send flowers to them,

1803
02:18:46,393 --> 02:18:48,461
to the families,
for Christ's sake.

1804
02:18:48,461 --> 02:18:51,132
Oh, wait, don't!
That looks guilty.

1805
02:18:51,132 --> 02:18:52,499
I'll call Michael.

1806
02:18:54,168 --> 02:18:56,137
What do you want me
to do in the meantime?

1807
02:18:56,137 --> 02:18:57,839
- With what?
- Well, our crew.

1808
02:18:59,372 --> 02:19:00,908
Let them go.

1809
02:19:00,908 --> 02:19:03,211
- You can't, sir, you cannot...
- Yes, I can!

1810
02:19:03,211 --> 02:19:05,847
Yes. Yes, I can!

1811
02:19:14,522 --> 02:19:17,191
People are gonna
write about this.

1812
02:19:17,191 --> 02:19:18,425
I'm staring down the barrel

1813
02:19:18,425 --> 02:19:21,028
of the next two goddamn
years of my life.

1814
02:19:21,028 --> 02:19:25,566
What if one of them dies?
What if they both die?

1815
02:19:25,566 --> 02:19:27,735
Who pays for it?
Are you gonna pay for it?

1816
02:19:27,735 --> 02:19:29,003
Are you gonna pay for it?

1817
02:19:29,837 --> 02:19:30,771
László,

1818
02:19:30,771 --> 02:19:32,340
in the interest of transparency,

1819
02:19:32,340 --> 02:19:33,708
before I came to retrieve you,

1820
02:19:33,708 --> 02:19:35,176
I'd already advised
Mr. Van Buren

1821
02:19:35,176 --> 02:19:36,944
- to cut his losses...
- Shut up, Leslie!

1822
02:19:38,646 --> 02:19:41,215
Sir. Sir, please.

1823
02:19:41,215 --> 02:19:43,618
Don't beg! It's unbecoming!

1824
02:19:50,524 --> 02:19:51,893
You're welcome to stay here

1825
02:19:51,893 --> 02:19:53,694
until you find your
footing elsewhere.

1826
02:19:55,129 --> 02:19:56,664
I have a mess to clean up.

1827
02:20:09,442 --> 02:20:10,745
I'm sorry, Gordon.

1828
02:20:11,612 --> 02:20:13,247
Don't apologize to me.

1829
02:20:13,247 --> 02:20:16,317
I will give you some money
while you look for something.

1830
02:20:16,317 --> 02:20:17,518
I'll be fine.

1831
02:20:18,185 --> 02:20:19,921
You have a kid.

1832
02:20:19,921 --> 02:20:22,957
I will give you something
and you will take it.

1833
02:20:26,027 --> 02:20:26,961
Listen

1834
02:20:28,896 --> 02:20:30,197
you got any, uh

1835
02:20:31,498 --> 02:20:33,567
any hop on you?

1836
02:20:33,567 --> 02:20:36,537
None at all. I'm off it.

1837
02:20:39,506 --> 02:20:40,875
Good.

1838
02:20:41,976 --> 02:20:43,644
Good. That's...

1839
02:20:45,212 --> 02:20:46,113
That's good to hear.

1840
02:21:05,967 --> 02:21:07,969
Stop it!

1841
02:21:07,969 --> 02:21:10,071
Stop it! You're
acting like a child.

1842
02:21:10,071 --> 02:21:11,272
It's over!

1843
02:21:11,272 --> 02:21:12,640
You're making me
a mess to clean up.

1844
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,774
It's over!

1845
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:17,912
You have to march
over there right now

1846
02:21:17,912 --> 02:21:19,680
and get him excited again.

1847
02:21:20,614 --> 02:21:22,984
Keep him engaged.

1848
02:21:22,984 --> 02:21:24,452
You know how these
rich fellows are.

1849
02:21:24,452 --> 02:21:25,987
For him, it's like

1850
02:21:25,987 --> 02:21:28,389
it's like refurbishing
a kitchen.

1851
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:31,225
Two people are in the hospital.

1852
02:21:31,225 --> 02:21:33,694
He does not want to proceed.

1853
02:21:33,694 --> 02:21:35,495
That's not your fault!

1854
02:21:41,102 --> 02:21:42,670
It's over.

1855
02:21:44,005 --> 02:21:45,505
Over.

1856
02:21:47,475 --> 02:21:48,609
Over.

1857
02:21:50,311 --> 02:21:51,645
Finished!

1858
02:22:05,659 --> 02:22:07,028
Good
evening, New York,

1859
02:22:07,028 --> 02:22:10,264
and happy holidays
from ABC News.

1860
02:22:10,264 --> 02:22:15,436
November 23rd, 1958,
marks an important milestone

1861
02:22:15,436 --> 02:22:17,138
in the fight against the East.

1862
02:22:17,138 --> 02:22:20,007
This morning, the
first full-range firing

1863
02:22:20,007 --> 02:22:24,945
of an intercontinental
ballistic missile, or ICBM,

1864
02:22:24,945 --> 02:22:28,115
was conducted by
the United States.

1865
02:22:28,115 --> 02:22:31,819
The missile was
an AGM-65 Maverick rocket.

1866
02:22:46,467 --> 02:22:50,771
All right.
Yes. I'll make a note of it.

1867
02:22:52,873 --> 02:22:54,075
Morning.

1868
02:22:54,075 --> 02:22:57,912
I'm looking for Rudolph
Heywood and Associates.

1869
02:22:57,912 --> 02:23:00,714
Pardon me, sir, but who is it
you're looking for?

1870
02:23:00,714 --> 02:23:03,451
László Tóth. He draws there.

1871
02:23:03,451 --> 02:23:05,286
Could I ask you to spell that?

1872
02:23:05,286 --> 02:23:10,591
- Yeah, it's, uh, L-A-S-L-O...
- Oh. Yes. I see him.

1873
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:12,660
The draughtsmen
are right upstairs.

1874
02:23:12,660 --> 02:23:15,129
All righty. Thank you, ma'am.

1875
02:23:35,249 --> 02:23:37,485
The Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade

1876
02:23:37,485 --> 02:23:39,186
is just around the corner,

1877
02:23:39,186 --> 02:23:43,958
and anticipation is building
for this annual spectacle.

1878
02:23:43,958 --> 02:23:46,260
On the political
front, New York...

1879
02:24:02,676 --> 02:24:03,911
László?

1880
02:24:11,252 --> 02:24:12,319
László?

1881
02:24:21,295 --> 02:24:22,696
Michael.

1882
02:24:25,299 --> 02:24:26,767
We have some news.

1883
02:24:28,269 --> 02:24:30,337
As do I.

1884
02:24:30,337 --> 02:24:33,841
How exciting. What
is it, László?

1885
02:24:34,808 --> 02:24:37,711
Please. Go ahead, Zsófia.

1886
02:24:39,581 --> 02:24:41,182
We are making Aliyah.

1887
02:24:42,316 --> 02:24:45,152
- What?
- We are going to Jerusalem.

1888
02:24:45,886 --> 02:24:47,556
I heard you.

1889
02:24:47,556 --> 02:24:49,490
Binyamin has family there.

1890
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:53,027
My older brothers relocated
with their families in 1950.

1891
02:24:53,027 --> 02:24:54,795
They became citizens.

1892
02:24:56,598 --> 02:24:59,767
Life is difficult there.

1893
02:24:59,767 --> 02:25:01,502
Have you thought this through?

1894
02:25:01,502 --> 02:25:03,237
It is our obligation.

1895
02:25:04,673 --> 02:25:06,307
To whom?

1896
02:25:06,307 --> 02:25:08,577
Our repatriation
is our liberation.

1897
02:25:08,577 --> 02:25:10,044
Oh, please...

1898
02:25:11,646 --> 02:25:13,347
Where will you live?

1899
02:25:14,448 --> 02:25:15,684
Hmm?

1900
02:25:15,684 --> 02:25:17,484
Where will you work?

1901
02:25:17,484 --> 02:25:21,222
We can stay with my brother's
family when we first arrive.

1902
02:25:21,222 --> 02:25:24,158
I was planning to
help with the baby.

1903
02:25:24,158 --> 02:25:26,360
My brother's wife
can help, also.

1904
02:25:27,494 --> 02:25:28,796
I know.

1905
02:25:29,863 --> 02:25:32,900
I am Jewish. My child is Jewish.

1906
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,401
We must go home now.

1907
02:25:34,401 --> 02:25:36,904
Does it somehow make us
less Jewish that we are here?

1908
02:25:36,904 --> 02:25:38,305
Are we not Jewish?

1909
02:25:41,308 --> 02:25:42,810
I see.

1910
02:25:44,646 --> 02:25:48,215
Perhaps Binyamin did not
recognize me to begin with.

1911
02:25:48,215 --> 02:25:49,450
He does.

1912
02:25:58,292 --> 02:25:59,393
I'm sorry.

1913
02:26:00,794 --> 02:26:02,162
No, I'm sorry.

1914
02:26:02,697 --> 02:26:04,031
I'm sorry.

1915
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:09,770
It's wonderful news.

1916
02:26:11,205 --> 02:26:12,873
Mmm-hmm.

1917
02:26:12,873 --> 02:26:15,943
We reacted badly out
of self-interest.

1918
02:26:17,945 --> 02:26:19,446
It is simply that

1919
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:23,450
we are going to miss you.

1920
02:26:24,818 --> 02:26:27,021
Well, we would like you to come.

1921
02:26:27,722 --> 02:26:30,491
Dear, we have jobs here.

1922
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:32,326
You could have a
better job in Israel.

1923
02:26:32,326 --> 02:26:33,460
I like my job.

1924
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:35,296
A woman's column.
It's beneath you.

1925
02:26:35,296 --> 02:26:37,364
I write for a paper
and I'm paid for it.

1926
02:26:38,999 --> 02:26:41,770
How many women my age
could make the same claim?

1927
02:26:47,207 --> 02:26:49,143
What's your news, László?

1928
02:26:52,446 --> 02:26:55,282
Harrison asked me back.

1929
02:27:10,164 --> 02:27:13,033
Michael came by
the office today.

1930
02:27:14,935 --> 02:27:17,905
Insurance monies came through.

1931
02:27:18,906 --> 02:27:21,175
They plan to for ego the library

1932
02:27:21,175 --> 02:27:24,244
to compensate for
legal expenses, but

1933
02:27:26,447 --> 02:27:29,049
they want to
complete the project.

1934
02:27:29,049 --> 02:27:31,018
I don't
like that man.

1935
02:27:31,018 --> 02:27:32,754
You scarcely knew him.

1936
02:27:32,754 --> 02:27:35,590
He dropped you
as quickly as he took you on.

1937
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:39,193
He's in
Roma on business.

1938
02:27:39,193 --> 02:27:40,662
He would like me to join him

1939
02:27:40,662 --> 02:27:45,232
to select the marble
for the altarpiece in Carrara.

1940
02:27:45,232 --> 02:27:48,570
I told you, for him,
it's like doing a kitchen.

1941
02:27:52,072 --> 02:27:53,240
Darling?

1942
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:54,709
Everyone
is leaving me.

1943
02:27:54,709 --> 02:27:56,544
- No, it isn't true.
- Isn't it?

1944
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:58,879
- No.
- No, it isn't.

1945
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:02,817
Uncle László is leaving you
only for a short time.

1946
02:28:02,817 --> 02:28:04,118
For some days.

1947
02:28:04,118 --> 02:28:07,522
And I will visit and so will
you. We will find a way.

1948
02:28:07,522 --> 02:28:09,123
I can
make arrangements

1949
02:28:09,123 --> 02:28:11,358
to have you dropped and
picked up at the newspaper.

1950
02:28:11,358 --> 02:28:14,428
No. It's not just this trip.

1951
02:28:16,163 --> 02:28:18,499
You'll be in
Doylestown again now.

1952
02:28:21,969 --> 02:28:24,004
I'll be fine on my own.

1953
02:28:32,781 --> 02:28:34,381
I will make arrangements.

1954
02:28:35,683 --> 02:28:38,853
Promise you won't
let it drive you mad.

1955
02:28:44,124 --> 02:28:45,660
I promise.

1956
02:29:02,544 --> 02:29:05,513
It's time to go!
You'll be late!

1957
02:29:05,513 --> 02:29:08,115
Yes, yes.
Yes, one minute.

1958
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:18,185
I must say,
Mr. Tóth, you look a mess.

1959
02:30:19,988 --> 02:30:21,455
I would expect your Elizabeth

1960
02:30:21,455 --> 02:30:23,223
to be taking better care of you.

1961
02:30:25,827 --> 02:30:28,663
The years have been difficult.

1962
02:30:28,663 --> 02:30:30,230
For us all.

1963
02:30:30,932 --> 02:30:32,132
For us all.

1964
02:30:32,934 --> 02:30:34,034
Huh.

1965
02:30:40,374 --> 02:30:41,776
Where the hell is he?

1966
02:30:44,779 --> 02:30:47,347
I'm sure he'll be...
be along any minute.

1967
02:30:49,416 --> 02:30:51,451
He lives in the mountains.

1968
02:30:52,554 --> 02:30:53,588
It takes time.

1969
02:30:57,959 --> 02:31:01,295
This is why I never
do business with Italians.

1970
02:31:01,295 --> 02:31:03,163
They're the spics of Europe.

1971
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:08,235
He's
right here now.

1972
02:31:11,204 --> 02:31:12,105
Finally, darling.

1973
02:31:12,105 --> 02:31:13,708
Che bello.

1974
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:21,181
- Mr. Van Buren.
- Orazio.

1975
02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:27,555
Hey...

1976
02:31:29,289 --> 02:31:30,758
What happened to his hand?

1977
02:31:33,327 --> 02:31:34,796
Dangerous work.

1978
02:31:43,605 --> 02:31:45,873
I've worn the wrong
shoes for this little trek.

1979
02:31:45,873 --> 02:31:48,610
Do you mind if I take your arm?

1980
02:31:48,610 --> 02:31:50,845
Step where I step,
you will be all right.

1981
02:33:36,884 --> 02:33:38,786
It
is beautiful, no?

1982
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:44,257
It is beautiful.

1983
02:33:46,359 --> 02:33:48,930
Exactly as you
described, László.

1984
02:34:01,508 --> 02:34:03,410
Extraordinary.

1985
02:34:30,104 --> 02:34:31,539
I'm so happy to see you again.

1986
02:34:31,539 --> 02:34:34,208
I am happy to see
you, old friend.

1987
02:34:34,208 --> 02:34:36,343
Such a life down the years.

1988
02:34:36,343 --> 02:34:37,912
And we are still here.

1989
02:34:54,796 --> 02:34:56,531
This is magic. Thank you.

1990
02:34:56,531 --> 02:34:58,398
László, László,

1991
02:34:58,398 --> 02:35:00,635
there will be a
big party tonight.

1992
02:35:00,635 --> 02:35:03,137
I remember how much
you love a party.

1993
02:35:04,071 --> 02:35:05,640

02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,161
Mr. Tóth?

2016
02:37:45,498 --> 02:37:47,668
It's time we return
to our quarters.

2017
02:37:58,446 --> 02:38:01,882
Orazio has very
kindly offered us

2018
02:38:01,882 --> 02:38:04,952
a place to sleep for the night.

2019
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:13,627
Mr. Tóth?

2020
02:38:29,877 --> 02:38:31,812
What have you done
to yourself?

2021
02:38:40,421 --> 02:38:42,256
It's a
shame seeing how

2022
02:38:44,025 --> 02:38:46,027
your people treat themselves.

2023
02:38:48,529 --> 02:38:50,264
If you resent your persecution,

2024
02:38:50,264 --> 02:38:52,433
why then do you make of yourself

2025
02:38:52,433 --> 02:38:53,901
such an easy target?

2026
02:38:55,236 --> 02:38:56,871
Hmm?

2027
02:38:58,105 --> 02:39:00,241
If you
act as a loafer,

2028
02:39:01,575 --> 02:39:04,545
living off hand-outs

2029
02:39:06,147 --> 02:39:07,748
a societal leech,

2030
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:11,052
how can you

2031
02:39:11,052 --> 02:39:14,288
how can you rightfully expect
a different result?

2032
02:39:17,792 --> 02:39:20,761
You... You have
so much potential.

2033
02:39:23,197 --> 02:39:24,799
Yet you squander it.

2034
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:39,280
Get it out. Let it out.

2035
02:39:42,216 --> 02:39:44,585
Let it out. It's all right.

2036
02:39:50,491 --> 02:39:51,959
It's all right.

2037
02:39:56,030 --> 02:39:58,567
Who do
you think you are?

2038
02:39:58,567 --> 02:40:00,401
Who do you think you are?

2039
02:40:00,401 --> 02:40:02,136
You think you're special?

2040
02:40:04,071 --> 02:40:06,373
You think you...

2041
02:40:06,373 --> 02:40:10,077
You just float directly above
all those you encounter

2042
02:40:10,077 --> 02:40:12,813
because you're beautiful, huh?

2043
02:40:12,813 --> 02:40:15,850
Because you're
educated?

2044
02:40:20,589 --> 02:40:22,389
You're just a tramp.

2045
02:40:22,389 --> 02:40:24,892
You're a lady of the night.

2046
02:40:24,892 --> 02:40:28,530
You're just a lady of the night.

2047
02:40:50,784 --> 02:40:57,858
♪ That's what you are ♪

2048
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:39,333
You were in quite
a state last night.

2049
02:41:41,769 --> 02:41:43,737
Orazio carried you to bed.

2050
02:41:50,211 --> 02:41:53,380
It's a four-hour train
to the airport in Fiumicino.

2051
02:41:54,748 --> 02:41:57,184
So you'll have time for a rest.

2052
02:42:00,221 --> 02:42:03,057
I hope your stomach is not
too sensitive on airplanes.

2053
02:44:52,861 --> 02:44:55,162
You see this, above us?

2054
02:44:55,162 --> 02:44:56,765
Measure the same distance

2055
02:44:56,765 --> 02:45:00,300
of three or perhaps
four inches between flats,

2056
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:04,438
and place each modular section
apart by that same distance.

2057
02:45:04,438 --> 02:45:06,206
Then what do we
do with the gaps?

2058
02:45:08,643 --> 02:45:13,782
We insert a thick sheet
of glass between the panels

2059
02:45:13,782 --> 02:45:15,916
to let the light in from above.

2060
02:45:18,586 --> 02:45:20,053
Give me some time
to think about it

2061
02:45:20,053 --> 02:45:21,523
and I'll come back to you.

2062
02:45:21,523 --> 02:45:23,023
Twenty-two.

2063
02:45:23,023 --> 02:45:24,826
- Twenty-three.
- What's going on here?

2064
02:45:24,826 --> 02:45:26,594
Twenty-four.

2065
02:45:26,594 --> 02:45:28,462
Twenty-five.

2066
02:45:28,462 --> 02:45:29,963
Twenty-six.

2067
02:45:29,963 --> 02:45:31,733
Twenty-seven.

2068
02:45:31,733 --> 02:45:33,568
Twenty-eight.

2069
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:35,436
Twenty-nine.

2070
02:45:35,436 --> 02:45:37,404
Thirty.

2071
02:45:37,404 --> 02:45:39,206
- Thirty-one.
- Stop it right now!

2072
02:45:39,206 --> 02:45:41,676
- Thirty-two.
- Stop it! Stop it right now!

2073
02:45:41,676 --> 02:45:44,445
You, what is your name, huh?

2074
02:45:44,445 --> 02:45:47,147
Are you stupid? You want
to pull this whole thing down?

2075
02:45:47,147 --> 02:45:48,783
Want to get them all killed?

2076
02:45:48,783 --> 02:45:52,052
Your childish show-boating
puts everyone here at risk!

2077
02:45:52,052 --> 02:45:54,121
Do you hear me?

2078
02:45:54,121 --> 02:45:55,790
Are you thick? Are you lame?

2079
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:59,026
Gordon, can you get him
to stop shouting at everyone?

2080
02:46:00,728 --> 02:46:02,095
I will.

2081
02:46:04,398 --> 02:46:06,300
You report
to the subcontractor.

2082
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:08,502
You tell him that
you've been let go.

2083
02:46:11,338 --> 02:46:12,774
- Get out of here!
- Hey!

2084
02:46:12,774 --> 02:46:14,274
What's wrong with you, László?

2085
02:46:14,274 --> 02:46:15,577
You kicked that boy.

2086
02:46:16,811 --> 02:46:18,212
Stay out of it, Gordon.

2087
02:46:19,446 --> 02:46:22,650
- What's wrong with you?
- Stay out of it.

2088
02:46:22,650 --> 02:46:25,753
Stay out of it, or
you can go with him!

2089
02:46:25,753 --> 02:46:28,723
You shout at me again
and you'll be sorry.

2090
02:46:31,158 --> 02:46:33,160
You too! You go!

2091
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,128
Go! Get out of here.

2092
02:46:36,631 --> 02:46:38,165
Get out of here.

2093
02:46:40,602 --> 02:46:43,403
You think I am playing
games with you?

2094
02:46:47,675 --> 02:46:50,210
Let's go. Let's go.

2095
02:46:50,210 --> 02:46:52,079
I only just arrived.

2096
02:46:53,413 --> 02:46:55,884
- Mr. Tóth.
- Oh, God.

2097
02:46:55,884 --> 02:46:57,184
Mr. Tóth, we need to talk

2098
02:46:57,184 --> 02:46:58,252
about these May-June
cost reports.

2099
02:46:58,252 --> 02:47:00,622
Not today, Jimmy, not today.

2100
02:47:00,622 --> 02:47:02,289
You can't keep
walking away from me

2101
02:47:02,289 --> 02:47:04,024
every time I step into a room.

2102
02:47:04,024 --> 02:47:06,460
This is not a room, Jim.

2103
02:47:06,460 --> 02:47:08,930
Honey, did I introduce you
to Jim Simpson?

2104
02:47:08,930 --> 02:47:11,231
Jim is the boss's lapdog

2105
02:47:11,231 --> 02:47:15,435
and architectural consultant
extraordinaire!

2106
02:47:15,435 --> 02:47:18,272
Jim designed a
hotel in Stamford.

2107
02:47:18,272 --> 02:47:19,774
László,
that's enough.

2108
02:47:19,774 --> 02:47:22,175
Come on, Jimmy, there must be
an unpaid parking meter

2109
02:47:22,175 --> 02:47:24,679
around here somewhere, huh?

2110
02:47:24,679 --> 02:47:26,179
Be vigilant!

2111
02:47:27,414 --> 02:47:29,149
Keep your eyes peeled!

2112
02:47:31,686 --> 02:47:34,822
What is it, huh?

2113
02:47:34,822 --> 02:47:38,325
It was unnecessary how
you treated that boy, is all.

2114
02:47:40,028 --> 02:47:42,697
Their safety is my priority.

2115
02:47:42,697 --> 02:47:45,198
It is not what you said
to that young man, it is how.

2116
02:47:45,198 --> 02:47:47,735
Gordon? Don't even
get me started.

2117
02:47:47,735 --> 02:47:50,437
Do you want to wait around
for another few years

2118
02:47:50,437 --> 02:47:54,909
for another lawsuit
to resolve itself?

2119
02:47:54,909 --> 02:47:58,145
Hmm? I am sick of it.

2120
02:47:58,145 --> 02:48:00,147
Sick! Do you hear me?

2121
02:48:01,248 --> 02:48:03,383
I finish this or
we are finished.

2122
02:48:03,383 --> 02:48:06,153
Speak for yourself.
I am not finished.

2123
02:48:06,153 --> 02:48:08,056
Living with you is impossible.

2124
02:48:08,056 --> 02:48:09,924
You've become a
selfish old bastard

2125
02:48:09,924 --> 02:48:11,025
right before my very eyes.

2126
02:48:11,025 --> 02:48:13,360
Don't say something
you'll regret in the morning.

2127
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:16,496
Do you want to kill us?

2128
02:48:16,496 --> 02:48:18,666
I'd get out of the car
and march all the way

2129
02:48:18,666 --> 02:48:22,102
back to Manhattan if I could,
you egotistic scoundrel!

2130
02:48:23,203 --> 02:48:26,173
There is no reason
for me to be here.

2131
02:48:26,173 --> 02:48:31,111
I'm here for you. I could do
my ridiculous job anywhere!

2132
02:48:31,111 --> 02:48:32,513
Do you think I
went to university

2133
02:48:32,513 --> 02:48:34,348
to write about lipsticks?

2134
02:48:35,148 --> 02:48:36,718
Shame on you!

2135
02:48:36,718 --> 02:48:40,420
We came here because it was
our only option!

2136
02:48:42,957 --> 02:48:46,226
- Attila was here...
- Who you refuse to see!

2137
02:48:46,226 --> 02:48:50,163
Ask him about that! Ask him.

2138
02:48:50,163 --> 02:48:53,768
Did he tell you he kicked me
to the street like a dog?

2139
02:48:53,768 --> 02:48:55,103
Did he?

2140
02:48:55,103 --> 02:48:58,271
His bitch, bitch wife accused me

2141
02:48:58,271 --> 02:48:59,974
of making a pass at her.

2142
02:48:59,974 --> 02:49:02,777
- You would never do that.
- I did not do that.

2143
02:49:02,777 --> 02:49:04,746
Then why would she
say such a thing?

2144
02:49:04,746 --> 02:49:06,614
Because they do
not want us here.

2145
02:49:06,614 --> 02:49:08,816
Of course
Attila wants us here.

2146
02:49:08,816 --> 02:49:10,785
- Not Attila.
- Then who do you mean?

2147
02:49:10,785 --> 02:49:14,154
The people here.
They do not want us here.

2148
02:49:16,390 --> 02:49:20,094
Audrey, Attila's Catholic wife,

2149
02:49:20,094 --> 02:49:21,696
does not want us here!

2150
02:49:22,563 --> 02:49:24,464
She does not want us here!

2151
02:49:29,403 --> 02:49:31,139
We are nothing.

2152
02:49:34,441 --> 02:49:35,910
We are worse than nothing.

2153
02:49:37,578 --> 02:49:39,246
You poor man.

2154
02:49:40,815 --> 02:49:42,482
My poor husband.

2155
02:49:45,653 --> 02:49:46,654
What...

2156
02:49:48,156 --> 02:49:49,857
What has been robbed of you?

2157
02:49:55,863 --> 02:49:57,765
- Zsófia!
- Shh.

2158
02:49:57,765 --> 02:49:59,399
- Zsófia!
- She's not here, darling.

2159
02:49:59,399 --> 02:50:00,568
She's not here.

2160
02:50:00,568 --> 02:50:03,104
- Zsó...
- Sorry I upset you. Please.

2161
02:50:03,104 --> 02:50:07,542
Get me my pills.

2162
02:50:07,542 --> 02:50:10,578
It's too much.

2163
02:50:10,578 --> 02:50:13,948
I'm in pain! I'm close to death!

2164
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:21,923
Darling?

2165
02:50:21,923 --> 02:50:24,659
There is only a
pill cut in halves.

2166
02:50:24,659 --> 02:50:27,061
Do you have more in your purse?

2167
02:50:27,061 --> 02:50:29,530
I can't.

2168
02:50:29,530 --> 02:50:31,298
Darling.

2169
02:50:31,298 --> 02:50:32,399
Take this, please.

2170
02:50:32,399 --> 02:50:34,135
Do you have more in your purse?

2171
02:50:35,870 --> 02:50:36,771
No?

2172
02:50:38,472 --> 02:50:40,307
This is
too much.

2173
02:50:40,307 --> 02:50:42,275
What will I do?

2174
02:50:42,275 --> 02:50:44,946
The pain. This is
too much, László.

2175
02:50:44,946 --> 02:50:48,015
Shh.

2176
02:51:01,596 --> 02:51:04,232
Darling,
I will find something.

2177
02:51:08,636 --> 02:51:12,039
Darling, come on.
Shh. Shh.

2178
02:51:15,308 --> 02:51:17,444
It's what they
gave me on the boat

2179
02:51:17,444 --> 02:51:19,412
for my broken face.

2180
02:51:24,218 --> 02:51:26,087
It'll help you feel better.

2181
02:51:26,087 --> 02:51:28,556
Just listen to my voice, dear.

2182
02:51:30,658 --> 02:51:32,760
That's it. Just
listen to my voice.

2183
02:51:34,996 --> 02:51:37,330
Listen to my voice.

2184
02:51:38,365 --> 02:51:39,734
There you go.

2185
02:51:41,135 --> 02:51:43,004
Listen to my voice.

2186
02:51:44,705 --> 02:51:46,641
There you go. Shh.

2187
02:51:48,242 --> 02:51:50,377
Listen to my voice.

2188
02:51:50,377 --> 02:51:51,813
Good, my dear.

2189
02:51:53,981 --> 02:51:55,348
There you go.

2190
02:51:57,251 --> 02:51:58,653
There you go.

2191
02:52:06,961 --> 02:52:07,962
Good.

2192
02:52:10,397 --> 02:52:12,700
Listen to
my voice, darling.

2193
02:52:20,074 --> 02:52:23,376
Do... Do you have more?

2194
02:53:00,281 --> 02:53:01,682
Keep going.

2195
02:53:10,091 --> 02:53:11,424
Harder.

2196
02:54:51,959 --> 02:54:53,493
Toilet.

2197
02:55:00,968 --> 02:55:02,103
Toilet.

2198
02:55:03,503 --> 02:55:04,839
Yes, dear.

2199
02:55:07,341 --> 02:55:08,242
Yes.

2200
02:55:13,581 --> 02:55:15,850
Up. Come, my dear.

2201
02:55:15,850 --> 02:55:18,019
Oh. Yeah.

2202
02:55:18,019 --> 02:55:19,420
Come on.

2203
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:20,921
Come...

2204
02:55:24,258 --> 02:55:26,394
Oh. All right?

2205
02:55:26,394 --> 02:55:28,696
I'll wait outside.

2206
02:55:28,696 --> 02:55:31,098
Okay? You tell me
when you need me.

2207
02:55:55,589 --> 02:55:56,857
Darling?

2208
02:55:59,593 --> 02:56:01,028
Have you finished?

2209
02:56:05,566 --> 02:56:07,568
Darling, can I come in?

2210
02:56:10,805 --> 02:56:13,774
Darling? Erzsébet?

2211
02:56:13,774 --> 02:56:16,277
Help. Help me. Help.

2212
02:56:16,277 --> 02:56:17,878
I need a
gurney, a stretcher!

2213
02:56:17,878 --> 02:56:19,146
Anything! Anything!

2214
02:56:19,146 --> 02:56:21,282
Help me.
Help, my wife is dying.

2215
02:56:21,282 --> 02:56:23,217
She'll be all right.
Okay, okay, okay.

2216
02:56:23,217 --> 02:56:25,520
- My wife is dying.
- She'll be all right.

2217
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:27,721
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

2218
02:56:27,721 --> 02:56:29,657
I know my wife,
she's dying.

2219
02:57:07,728 --> 02:57:09,997
Last night, I met God.

2220
02:57:11,165 --> 02:57:14,702
He granted me permission
to call Him by His name.

2221
02:57:17,338 --> 02:57:19,773
It is not the first
time we have met.

2222
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:26,213
What did you do
to me, my László?

2223
02:57:29,584 --> 02:57:31,652
It was an accident.

2224
02:57:37,057 --> 02:57:39,960
Do you remember everything
you confessed to me

2225
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:41,829
at home in our bed?

2226
02:57:48,102 --> 02:57:50,971
Oh, you needn't be
ashamed, my darling.

2227
02:57:52,773 --> 02:57:54,308
The harm done unto us

2228
02:57:54,308 --> 02:57:57,178
was done only to
our physical bodies.

2229
02:57:58,913 --> 02:58:00,447
You were right.

2230
02:58:02,750 --> 02:58:04,885
This place is rotten.

2231
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:09,690
The landscape, the food we eat,

2232
02:58:09,690 --> 02:58:11,926
this whole country is rotten.

2233
02:58:14,929 --> 02:58:16,964
I'm going to Israel

2234
02:58:16,964 --> 02:58:19,233
to be with Zsófia and her child.

2235
02:58:21,168 --> 02:58:23,804
I want to become the
grandmother to her

2236
02:58:23,804 --> 02:58:26,273
that she will otherwise
never encounter.

2237
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:35,115
Come home with me.

2238
02:58:41,355 --> 02:58:43,023
Come home with me.

2239
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:48,462
I will follow you.

2240
02:58:51,666 --> 02:58:54,001
I will follow you until I die.

2241
03:00:01,368 --> 03:00:03,337
Mrs. Tóth.

2242
03:00:03,337 --> 03:00:06,240
You're standing.
How lovely to see.

2243
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:08,543
- Do you need a hand?
- I'm all right, thank you.

2244
03:00:08,543 --> 03:00:10,277
Is Mr. Tóth here as well?

2245
03:00:10,277 --> 03:00:12,580
- Just me, I'm afraid.
- Oh.

2246
03:00:12,580 --> 03:00:14,848
To what do we owe the pleasure?

2247
03:00:14,848 --> 03:00:16,984
Is your father in?

2248
03:00:16,984 --> 03:00:19,453
Sure. We were just
sitting down for dinner.

2249
03:00:19,453 --> 03:00:21,790
No trouble at all,
I'm happy to wait

2250
03:00:21,790 --> 03:00:23,057
until you're all finished.

2251
03:00:24,391 --> 03:00:25,993
Don't be silly.

2252
03:00:25,993 --> 03:00:27,494
I'll ask the kitchen
to fix you a plate.

2253
03:00:28,329 --> 03:00:31,865
You're kind, Maggie. Thank you.

2254
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:35,069
Follow me.

2255
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:41,442
You can finally meet my fiancé.

2256
03:00:45,479 --> 03:00:47,915
Are you sure you
don't need a hand?

2257
03:00:47,915 --> 03:00:49,049
I'm fine.

2258
03:00:52,252 --> 03:00:53,954
Mrs. Tóth.

2259
03:00:53,954 --> 03:00:55,590
You're up on your feet.

2260
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:58,092
Please, sit.

2261
03:00:59,193 --> 03:01:00,461
Where's László?

2262
03:01:02,930 --> 03:01:04,932
He's caught a flu.

2263
03:01:05,633 --> 03:01:07,501
He's recovering at home.

2264
03:01:07,501 --> 03:01:09,604
Well, that explains it.

2265
03:01:09,604 --> 03:01:11,706
Jim Simpson mentioned
he hadn't been on site

2266
03:01:11,706 --> 03:01:13,140
since last Friday.

2267
03:01:13,140 --> 03:01:15,309
- Shame.
- Yes.

2268
03:01:16,043 --> 03:01:18,445
A terrible shame.

2269
03:01:18,445 --> 03:01:19,913
It's going around.

2270
03:01:20,582 --> 03:01:23,016
Please. Sit down.

2271
03:01:23,016 --> 03:01:24,552
I'm fine to stand.

2272
03:01:26,554 --> 03:01:28,021
Fine to stand?

2273
03:01:29,858 --> 03:01:31,526
Is something wrong, Mrs. Tóth?

2274
03:01:33,961 --> 03:01:37,965
Yes.
Something is wrong.

2275
03:01:41,068 --> 03:01:43,605
I have come tonight
to tell you something

2276
03:01:43,605 --> 03:01:46,440
that is going to be
very difficult to hear.

2277
03:01:48,843 --> 03:01:50,578
For you people, too.

2278
03:01:52,847 --> 03:01:58,653
I don't know you, but it will
be difficult for you to hear.

2279
03:01:58,653 --> 03:02:00,421
If this is a
professional matter,

2280
03:02:00,421 --> 03:02:03,123
then perhaps you and I should
talk in the other room.

2281
03:02:05,560 --> 03:02:07,695
Your father is a rapist.

2282
03:02:11,165 --> 03:02:12,600
Excuse me?

2283
03:02:15,235 --> 03:02:16,970
Whatever this is supposed to be,

2284
03:02:16,970 --> 03:02:19,506
I don't like it.

2285
03:02:19,506 --> 03:02:21,408
I'm calling your husband
to come and fetch you.

2286
03:02:21,408 --> 03:02:25,713
Your father is an evil rapist.

2287
03:02:25,713 --> 03:02:28,482
Daddy,
what is she talking about?

2288
03:02:28,482 --> 03:02:29,717
Look at him.

2289
03:02:30,919 --> 03:02:32,953
He cannot say anything.

2290
03:02:36,190 --> 03:02:38,425
Did something happen
between you and Mrs. Tóth?

2291
03:02:38,425 --> 03:02:41,962
- It wasn't me.
- That's enough!

2292
03:02:41,962 --> 03:02:45,633
You come in here making vague,
laughable accusations.

2293
03:02:45,633 --> 03:02:48,268
I want you out of our
house this instant.

2294
03:02:48,268 --> 03:02:51,573
Tell them
what you did to my husband.

2295
03:02:52,607 --> 03:02:54,742
Tell them what you did.

2296
03:02:59,647 --> 03:03:00,981
Your husband is sick.

2297
03:03:02,082 --> 03:03:05,787
He's alcoholic. Drug-addicted.

2298
03:03:05,787 --> 03:03:09,990
I don't know why he wishes
to hurt me, to humiliate me.

2299
03:03:11,358 --> 03:03:13,327
I have offered him
nothing but kindness.

2300
03:03:14,762 --> 03:03:18,232
He's a sick, senile old dog

2301
03:03:19,233 --> 03:03:22,503
and when dogs get sick, they

2302
03:03:22,503 --> 03:03:25,607
they often bite the hand
of those who fed them,

2303
03:03:25,607 --> 03:03:28,475
until someone mercifully
puts them down.

2304
03:03:30,310 --> 03:03:34,281
Now, if you will excuse me.

2305
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:39,988
I think I've endured enough
abuse for one evening.

2306
03:03:39,988 --> 03:03:42,155
You can tell your husband

2307
03:03:42,155 --> 03:03:44,526
he is off the payroll
now and forever as well.

2308
03:03:44,526 --> 03:03:46,995
I will
not excuse you!

2309
03:03:46,995 --> 03:03:48,963
- Get out!
- No!

2310
03:03:48,963 --> 03:03:52,432
Harry!
Harry, let her go!

2311
03:03:52,432 --> 03:03:57,504
You are not excused,
Harrison Van Buren!

2312
03:03:58,505 --> 03:04:00,107
- Shame!
- Out!

2313
03:04:00,107 --> 03:04:02,610
Shame on you!

2314
03:04:02,610 --> 03:04:05,780
Mrs. Tóth, I'm sorry.
Mrs. Tóth.

2315
03:04:07,649 --> 03:04:08,883
Here.

2316
03:04:08,883 --> 03:04:11,553
- I'm fine.
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.

2317
03:04:11,553 --> 03:04:12,921
Can you help me to my car?

2318
03:04:12,921 --> 03:04:15,489
Yes. Sure.

2319
03:04:15,489 --> 03:04:17,391
A taxi is waiting
for me at the front.

2320
03:04:19,226 --> 03:04:20,294
I'm so sorry

2321
03:04:20,294 --> 03:04:22,429
for the bizarre
interruption, gentlemen.

2322
03:04:23,463 --> 03:04:25,934
Harry, Harry, we're leaving.

2323
03:04:25,934 --> 03:04:28,536
No! No, don't leave. Please.

2324
03:04:28,536 --> 03:04:31,405
Harry, your father's
gone to bed, anyhow.

2325
03:04:41,816 --> 03:04:43,317
What have you done?

2326
03:04:49,691 --> 03:04:50,792
Father?

2327
03:04:53,761 --> 03:04:55,362
Father?

2328
03:04:58,098 --> 03:04:59,667
It's over now.

2329
03:05:11,879 --> 03:05:14,348
Father! She's gone.

2330
03:05:20,220 --> 03:05:22,056
Dad?

2331
03:05:23,858 --> 03:05:24,892
Dad?

2332
03:05:28,596 --> 03:05:31,365
Where the hell has he gone?
Call for him outside.

2333
03:05:37,170 --> 03:05:38,438
Dad?

2334
03:05:41,909 --> 03:05:42,910
Dad?

2335
03:05:46,213 --> 03:05:47,582
Harrison?

2336
03:05:49,917 --> 03:05:51,284
Harrison?

2337
03:05:52,820 --> 03:05:55,489
He must have left the house,
I can't find him anywhere.

2338
03:05:58,726 --> 03:05:59,861
Daddy?

2339
03:06:02,362 --> 03:06:03,698
Harrison?

2340
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:08,268
Mr. Van Buren?

2341
03:06:08,268 --> 03:06:09,737
Harrison?

2342
03:06:11,338 --> 03:06:12,740
Mr. Van Buren?

2343
03:06:15,943 --> 03:06:17,812
Father?

2344
03:06:17,812 --> 03:06:18,913
Dad?

2345
03:06:21,683 --> 03:06:23,383
Daddy?

2346
03:06:23,383 --> 03:06:25,153
Shine a bit more light
on this side here.

2347
03:06:31,893 --> 03:06:33,427
Harrison?

2348
03:06:48,442 --> 03:06:49,944
Van Buren?

2349
03:06:52,146 --> 03:06:53,548
You see anything?

2350
03:07:00,655 --> 03:07:02,289
There's a door there.

2351
03:07:06,728 --> 03:07:08,629
It's locked!
Can't get inside!

2352
03:07:19,140 --> 03:07:20,608
There's a telephone number

2353
03:07:20,608 --> 03:07:21,943
for a groundskeeper
at the front.

2354
03:07:21,943 --> 03:07:23,243
Come on.

2355
03:07:47,467 --> 03:07:49,402
What is this place?

2356
03:07:49,402 --> 03:07:51,172
It's the condensate
return system.

2357
03:07:51,172 --> 03:07:52,774
Drain pumps.

2358
03:08:08,055 --> 03:08:09,456
Harrison?

2359
03:08:29,610 --> 03:08:31,712
Think we've got something
over here, Lieutenant.

2360
03:10:54,422 --> 03:10:56,757
They look beautiful
like this, don't you think?

2361
03:11:10,237 --> 03:11:12,039
Excuse us, sir.

2362
03:12:15,736 --> 03:12:17,238
Good evening.

2363
03:12:27,248 --> 03:12:32,686
My uncle is, above all,
a principled artist.

2364
03:12:35,222 --> 03:12:40,294
His lifelong ambition was not
only to define an epoch,

2365
03:12:40,294 --> 03:12:42,263
but to transcend all time.

2366
03:12:43,898 --> 03:12:48,436
In his memoirs, he described
his designs as machines

2367
03:12:48,436 --> 03:12:50,805
with no superfluous parts.

2368
03:12:50,805 --> 03:12:55,709
That, at their
best, at his best,

2369
03:12:56,944 --> 03:12:59,914
possessed an immoveable core,

2370
03:12:59,914 --> 03:13:02,950
a hard core of beauty.

2371
03:13:02,950 --> 03:13:07,221
A way of directing their
inhabitants' perception

2372
03:13:07,221 --> 03:13:09,590
into the world as it is.

2373
03:13:09,590 --> 03:13:12,259
The inherent laws
of concrete things

2374
03:13:12,259 --> 03:13:16,263
such as mountains
and rock define them.

2375
03:13:16,263 --> 03:13:18,666
They indicate nothing.

2376
03:13:18,666 --> 03:13:20,535
They tell nothing.

2377
03:13:20,535 --> 03:13:22,436
They simply are.

2378
03:13:22,436 --> 03:13:24,438
Born in 1911

2379
03:13:24,438 --> 03:13:27,208
in a small fishing village
in Austria-Hungary,

2380
03:13:27,208 --> 03:13:30,511
László Tóth looked out
upon the Adriatic Sea.

2381
03:13:30,511 --> 03:13:34,549
He was a boy with eyes
wide open, full of yearning.

2382
03:13:34,549 --> 03:13:36,283
New borders would eventually

2383
03:13:36,283 --> 03:13:39,487
rip this expanse of
sea away from him,

2384
03:13:39,487 --> 03:13:43,891
but never did he stop
to try and fill its void.

2385
03:13:43,891 --> 03:13:47,294
Forty years later, he survived
the camp at Buchenwald,

2386
03:13:47,294 --> 03:13:50,998
as did his late wife,
and myself, in Dachau.

2387
03:13:50,998 --> 03:13:53,400
His first American masterpiece,

2388
03:13:53,400 --> 03:13:56,737
the Van Buren Institute
outside of Philadelphia,

2389
03:13:56,737 --> 03:14:00,374
remained unfinished until 1973.

2390
03:14:00,374 --> 03:14:04,211
The building referenced
his time at Buchenwald,

2391
03:14:04,211 --> 03:14:08,782
as well as the deeply felt
absence of his wife,

2392
03:14:08,782 --> 03:14:10,951
my aunt, Erzsébet.

2393
03:14:11,919 --> 03:14:13,687
For this project,

2394
03:14:13,687 --> 03:14:17,992
he re-imagined the camp's
claustrophobic interior cells

2395
03:14:17,992 --> 03:14:20,461
with precisely the
same dimensions

2396
03:14:20,461 --> 03:14:23,164
as his own place
of imprisonment,

2397
03:14:23,164 --> 03:14:26,267
save for one
electrifying exception.

2398
03:14:28,002 --> 03:14:31,438
When visitors looked
20 meters upwards,

2399
03:14:31,438 --> 03:14:35,075
the dramatic heights
of the glass roof above them

2400
03:14:35,075 --> 03:14:38,312
invited free thought,
freedom of identity.

2401
03:14:38,312 --> 03:14:41,348
He further
re-imagined Buchenwald

2402
03:14:41,348 --> 03:14:45,587
and his wife's venue
of imprisonment, Dachau,

2403
03:14:45,587 --> 03:14:47,221
on the same grounds,

2404
03:14:48,923 --> 03:14:51,759
connected by a myriad
of secret corridors,

2405
03:14:51,759 --> 03:14:56,598
re-writing their history,
transcending space and time,

2406
03:14:56,598 --> 03:14:59,900
so that he and Erzsébet
would never be apart again.

2407
03:15:02,169 --> 03:15:03,270
Uncle

2408
03:15:04,939 --> 03:15:07,408
you and Aunt Erzsébet
once spoke for me.

2409
03:15:07,408 --> 03:15:11,546
I speak for you
now, and am honored.

2410
03:15:11,546 --> 03:15:14,949
"Don't let anyone fool you,
Zsófia," he would say to me

2411
03:15:14,949 --> 03:15:19,086
as a struggling young mother
raising my daughter

2412
03:15:19,086 --> 03:15:22,923
during our first
years in Jerusalem.

2413
03:15:22,923 --> 03:15:25,726
